Nonetheless, as unique data properties have inspired distinct and powerful learning principles, this paper aims to explore their potentials towards mitigating adversarial inputs. In particular, our results reveal the importance of using the temporal dependency in audio data to gain discriminate power against adversarial examples. Tested on the automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks and three recent audio adversarial attacks, we find that (i) input transformation developed from image adversarial defense provides limited robustness improvement and is subtle to advanced attacks; (ii) temporal dependency can be exploited to gain discriminative power against audio adversarial examples and is resistant to adaptive attacks considered in our experiments. Our results not only show promising means of improving the robustness of ASR systems, but also offer novel insights in exploiting domain-specific data properties to mitigate negative effects of adversarial examples.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">audio adversarial example, mitigation, detection, machine learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Adversarial audio discrimination using temporal dependency</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">7 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_ryx9MuhU6Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting findings but hard to fully understand the experiments.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1g4E3C9t7&amp;noteId=ryx9MuhU6Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1439 AnonReviewer4</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">12 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1439 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposed a study on audio adversarial examples and conclude the input transformation-based defenses do not work very well on the audio domain, especially for adaptive attacks. They also point out the importance of temporal dependency in designing defenses which is specific for the audio domain. This observation is very interesting and inspiring as temporal dependency is an important character that should be paid attention to in the field of audio adversarial examples. They also design some adaptive attacks to the defense based on temporal dependency but either fail to attack the system or can be detected by the defense.

Based on the results in Table S7, it seems like being aware of the parameter k when designing attacks are very helpful for reducing the AUC score. My question is if the attacker uses the random sample K_A to generate the adversarial examples, then how the performance would be. Another limitation of this work is that the proposed defense can differentiate the adversarial examples to some extent, but the ASR is not able to make a right prediction for adversarial examples. In addition, the writing of Section 4 is not very clear and easy to follow.

In all, this paper proposed some interesting findings and point out a very important direction for audio adversarial examples. If the author can improve the writing in experiments and answer the above questions, I would support for the acceptance.

Two versions of this problem are considered: attacks against audio classification and against text to speech. The authors first study a the practice of input transformations as means of defense against adversarial examples. To do so, they evaluate three recent adversarial attacks on audio classification and TTS models trained on several datasets. It is found that input transformations have limited utility against adaptive attacks. Moreover, a novel type of defense is developed in which the prefix (of some fixed length) of the audio input is converted to text and compared with the prefix of the text output of the entire input, flagging the input as adversarial if sufficient mismatch is detected. It is found that this method is robust against a number of attacks.

This paper tackles a relevant problem and presents some surprising (the robustness of the prefix method) as well as some not surprising results. The evaluation has reasonable enough breadth to give the conclusions credibility. 

My main complaint is that the exposition is somewhat hard to follow at places, especially in section 4. It is hard to keep track of which attack is applied to which scenario and what the conclusions were. Perhaps this could be summarized in some kind of high-level table. It would also be greatly beneficial if the attacks are briefly summarized somewhere. E.g., without following the references, it is completely unclear what is the "Commander Song" setting and what is it important. 
Finally, I would advise the authors to not use the term "first k portion". This made understanding their proposed defense much harder than it needed to be. Perhaps "prefix of length k" or something along these lines would be easier to follow. 

In summary, if the authors commit to improving the clarity of the paper,  I would be willing to support its acceptance by virtue of the breadth of the investigation and the importance of the problem.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SJxUvUaK27" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Review</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1g4E3C9t7&amp;noteId=SJxUvUaK27"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1439 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1439 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper investigates adversarial examples for audio data. The standard defense techniques proposed for images are studied in the context of audio. It is shown that these techniques are somewhat robust to adversarial attacks, but fail against adaptive attacks. A method exploiting the temporal dependencies of the data is then presented and shown to be robust to adversarial examples and to adaptive attacks.

The paper addresses an important issue, and the two main findings of the paper, the transformation methods used in computer vision are not useful against audio adversarial example and using temporal dependencies improves the defense capability are significant. The proposed TD method is novel.

The first part of the paper is easy to read (Section 1-3), but Section 4 is hard to follow, for the following reasons:
* Section 4.1 presents the metrics used in the evaluation, which is nice. But in the following subsections, other metrics are used: effectiveness ratio, detection rate and relative perturbation. They should be clearly defined in 4.1, and the authors should discuss why they used these metrics.
* Section 4.2 should be reorganized as it is hard to follow: there are three types of attack, so one subsection per attack should make the section clearer.
* It's not always clear what each attack is doing and why it is used. I suggest the authors to have a separate subsection with the description of each attack and the motivation of why it is used.

Because of the above, it's hard to clearly assess the performance of each method for each attack, it would be better to have a Table that summarizes the results for the transformation methods. Also, I don't understand the statement in 4.2: "We report that the autoencoder works fine for transforming benign instances (57.6% WER in Common Voice compared to 27.5%)": given that it's not an attack, the PER should be the same with and without transform, as we don't want the transform to affect non-adversarial examples ? Please clarify that.
The experiments on the proposed TD method are clear enough to show the viability of the approach.

Overall, the findings of this paper are significant and it is good step towards audio adversarial examples defense. But the experimental part is hard to follow and does not bring a clear picture. I am still willing to accept the paper if the authors improve and clarify Section 4.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJxqwKRJ2m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>example for TEMPORAL DEPENDENCY BASED METHOD</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1g4E3C9t7&amp;noteId=BJxqwKRJ2m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">26 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1439 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Hi, for TEMPORAL DEPENDENCY BASED METHOD, you only show the example that perturbs a sentence to a totally different one without any same words.

First, in this work we aim to detect the state-of-the-art attacks such as [Carlini et al], and therefore we obtain their adversarial examples online directly and perform detection for the purpose of fair comparison.
In addition, we conduct a new set of experiments these days based on your suggestion.
In particular, we set the adversarial target as just modifying one single word, such as  it -&gt; he, morning -&gt; evening, open -&gt; close, and perform the TD detection against them (we list some examples in the end of this answer). Overall, for 50 samples, if we choose a single k, the AUC based on WER and CER score are around 0.65, and LCP 0.7.
We also try to perform TD based on ensemble of k as k = (3/8, 4/8, 5/8, 6/8, 7/8} and select the maximum score among WER / CER / LCP for each k, which leads to AUC =0.832.
This shows that TD still performs effectively for detecting such “single word” adversarial audio, though less powerful than detecting those with larger perturbation. 
The reason is obvious by looking at the examples below. In each example, row 1 shows the translation result of the first k portion (TD), row 2 shows the “single word” adversarial target (Adv), while row 3 denotes the original benign translation (Benign).
We can see that the perturbation of such “single word attack” will only introduce inconsistency for the “target word”, and therefore reduce the gap between adversarial and benign instances. Though harder to detect, such attacks limit the adversary’s attack ability in practice. If we want to detect them more effectively, better similarity metrics may be helpful, and we will explore such metrics in our future work.

Yes, we indeed allow the distortion to be the largest possible in practice, which is the amplitude of the original audio waveform. If the distortion is larger than the original audio waveform, the benign audio will be totally covered by the adversarial one and hence the adversarial attack will become trivial but meaningless.

Such rational setting for maximum distortion is also mentioned in (Carlini et al. 2018), and we will add corresponding discussion in our updated version as well. Thank you for pointing this out.
