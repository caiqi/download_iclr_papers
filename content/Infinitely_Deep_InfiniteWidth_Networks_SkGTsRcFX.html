Nevertheless, until now, infinite-width networks have been limited to at most two hidden layers. To address this shortcoming, we study the initialisation requirements of these networks and show that the main challenge for constructing them is defining the appropriate sampling distributions for the weights. Based on these observations, we propose a principled approach to weight initialisation that correctly accounts for the functional nature of the hidden layer activations and facilitates the construction of arbitrarily many infinite-width layers, thus enabling the construction of arbitrarily deep infinite-width networks. The main idea of our approach is to iteratively reparametrise the hidden-layer activations into appropriately defined reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and use the canonical way of constructing probability distributions over these spaces for specifying the required weight distributions in a principled way. Furthermore, we examine the practical implications of this construction for standard, finite-width networks. In particular, we derive a novel weight initialisation scheme for standard, finite-width networks that takes into account the structure of the data and information about the task at hand. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this weight initialisation approach on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Year Prediction MSD datasets.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Infinite-width networks, initialisation, kernel methods, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, Gaussian processes</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We propose a method for the construction of arbitrarily deep infinite-width networks, based on which we derive a novel weight initialisation scheme for finite-width networks and demonstrate its competitive performance.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJldu_uza7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>The idea proposed in the paper is interesting but the paper appears quite incomplete</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkGT6sRcFX&amp;noteId=BJldu_uza7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper848 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">09 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper848 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">In this paper, the authors propose deep neural networks of infinite width. The primary challenge in such networks is defining a distribution over the weights connecting two layers of infinite width. The authors tackle this by using Gaussian Processes for these distributions with the covariance functions defined in a canonical manner. Inspired by these networks, the authors propose weight initialization schemes for finite width networks.

While the idea proposed in the paper is interesting, the paper appears quite incomplete. In particular, the authors do not mention a single example of a kernel that can be constructed using the process outlined in Section 3. Furthermore, the only application of these infinitely wide networks proposed in this paper is for initialization of the weights of finite width networks. It will perhaps be more interesting if the authors can use the kernels obtained for supervised learning tasks using kernel machines (as done in Cho &amp; Saul 2009) or as the covariance function of a Gaussian process (as done in Wilson et al. 2014).

Moreover, the experiments conducted on finite width networks are not enough to justify the utility of this initialization scheme. It will be useful if the authors can test the performance of the state-of-the-art networks for CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, where the weights of the last fully connected layer have been sampled from different distributions. An extension to initialization for convolutional layers will further strengthen the paper.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJlx_rSo3m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Systematic theoretical work with some supporting experiments</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkGT6sRcFX&amp;noteId=rJlx_rSo3m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper848 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper848 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary:
I'm not very familiar with the work this is building off of, but my summary is as follows:
The authors look at the problem of defining multilayer infinite width neural networks. The main challenge is that the weights (which are in some sense now a function) must be appropriately sampled to ensure that norms don't explode. 

This has only been done for two layers before, and the authors derive how to do this for more than two hidden layers using RKHSs. This initialization is called Win-Win, and is compared to different initializations on a few different datasets.

Clarity: This paper is quite technical and hard to follow without knowledge of the prior work. I think the authors could have been a little clearer on some of the challenges. E.g. instead of talking about the weights needing to be "in the same function space", it would be helpful to remphasise the norm issue.

Comments:
I'm not sure about the high level motivation for developing networks of this kind. In particular, none of the performance numbers are near state of the art (not necessary for developing new promising methods!) but I don't know exactly what the initialization buys in this setting.

Also, it would have been nice to see whether the Win-Win initialization is only useful for larger width networks compared to smaller width i.e. do other initialization schemes work better in this latter setting?

The derivations are interesting though, so I still recommend accept.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1ezww6Up7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Novel theoretical contribution with practical consequences supported by experiments</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkGT6sRcFX&amp;noteId=r1ezww6Up7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper848 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">12 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper848 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">We thank the reviewer for their time and comments.

In the case of infinite-width networks, both the activations and weight “vectors” (connecting one layer with one neuron in the subsequent layer) are infinite-dimensional “vectors”, i.e. they are representable by functions. In order to be able to compute the inner product between activations and weights, these objects need to be in the same function space. If they are not in the same function space, then we cannot compute inner products between these quantities and therefore cannot define infinite-width networks correctly. If we assume that the activations are sufficiently well-behaved then the function space that they span will be a subset of, for example, L_{2}. In that case, we can characterise these functions in terms of their norms.  

With regard to the comment on the norm issue, in general we do not know how well-behaved activations are and are therefore not able to characterize the space of activations in terms of norms. Thus, in general, we have no way of quantifying the space of activations in terms of norms and cannot further address this issue apart from emphasizing that the activations and weights need to be in the same function space.

The main contribution of this paper is theoretical, namely a method to construct infinite-width networks with arbitrarily many layers (Proposition 1 in our submission). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that allows us to go beyond just two layers of infinite width. Historically, single-layer infinite-width networks have played an important role in helping us acquire a deeper understanding of standard, finite-width networks. Being able to construct deep infinite-width networks should help us gain a better understanding of deep, finite-width networks that have transformed the field dramatically over the last decade. This summarises our main motivation for developing a construction approach for deep infinite-width networks. 

Apart from purely theoretical merit, our theoretical contribution also has immediate practical implications. In particular, we can transfer some of our findings from the infinite-width case to finite-width networks. Specifically, we show how our proposed construction approach gives rise to a novel weight initialisation scheme for finite-width networks that we term Win-Win.

Due to the theoretical nature and mathematical complexity involved, we agree that this paper is rather technical. We therefore tried to ease the reader into the challenges of defining deep infinite-width networks (see Section 3.1). We thank the reviewer for the comment about clarity and welcome any further comments on what we could add to the text to make this topic more approachable.

Although the main contribution of this paper is theoretical in nature, we also discuss some practical implications of the developed theory. Note that the main motivation of this paper is expanding our understanding of neural networks. Thus, the practical implications discussed should be seen as highlighting the practical relevance of the proposed theory and not as an attempt at developing a new training heuristic for achieving state-of-the-art performance. 

To highlight the implications of the developed theory, we conducted experiments on benchmark datasets across different task domains. In particular, the experimental results are there to demonstrate that our theoretical contribution has direct and practical relevance, and to validate the theory developed in the paper. 

Furthermore, in order to adequately validate the developed theory, we needed to disentangle the effect of initialisation on network performance from the effects of other training heuristics. To this end, we purposefully did not use any advanced techniques, such as data augmentation or learning rate scheduling, all of which are commonly used to improve state-of-the-art performance. In the experimental setup, we tested Win-Win against commonly used initialisation methods on three benchmark datasets in classification and regression, thus showing that the advantages of Win-Win are not tied to one particular dataset or even one particular task.

If you have any further comments, suggestions or questions, we would appreciate them. Given the above explanations, we would also kindly like to ask you to consider raising the rating of this paper. Thank you!

This paper uses kernel mappings between any two layers for weight initialisation. Using the representer theorem, a proper distribution for weights is constructed in H_{k_i} instead of being learned by \phi_i, and then is formulated as a GP. 

Cons:

However, there are some key issues.
1. The so-called “infinite width” is just yielded by kernels in RKHS for weight initialization. For practical implementation, the authors use this scheme with random Fourier features to construct finite-width network. A key issue is that how to guarantee that the approximated weights are still in the same space? For example, weights can be in RKHS, but their approximation might be not in RKHS. See in [S1] for details.
 
[S1] Generalization Properties of Learning with Random Features, NIPS 2017.
 
2. Experimental part is not very convincing. First, the authors just compare different initialization schemes. The used architectures are simple and not representative. Second, the overall performance is not satisfactory, and the compared classification datasets are quite small. Overall, the experimental results are inadequate and unconvincing.

Summary:
The paper attempts to proposal a weight initialization scheme to enable infinite deep infinite-width networks. However, there are some key issues not address such as whether the approximated weights are still in the same space and the limited experimental results.
