To prevent the issue, many researchers have proposed several defense techniques such as adversarial training, input transformation, stochastic activation pruning, etc.
In this paper, we propose a novel defense technique, Pixel Redrawn (PR) method, which redraws every pixel of training images to convert them into distorted images.
The motivation for our PR method is from the observation that the adversarial attacks have redrawn some pixels of the original image with the known parameters of the trained neural network.
Mimicking these attacks, our PR method redraws the image without any knowledge of the trained neural network.
This method can be similar to the adversarial training method but our PR method can be used to prevent future attacks.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets indicate our PR method not only relieves the over-fitting issue when we train neural networks with a large number of epochs, but it also boosts the robustness of the neural network.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">adversarial machine learning, deep learning, adversarial example</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">25 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SyxSjsbc37" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A simple noisy perturbation scheme for improving robustness of CNN</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ez_sRcFQ&amp;noteId=SyxSjsbc37"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposed the pixel redrawing approach to generate distorted training images to improve the performance of the deep networks, which hopefully can be used to prevent future attacks. The key idea is to randomly perturb the pixel values according pre-defined range and probabilities.


The proposed method is quite simple and is similar to denoising autoencoders in flavor.  My concern is that a pre-defined noisy perturbation may not be general enough to tackle various types of attacks. Ideally the perturbation should take into account properties of the input images, both pixel-wise and structure-wise. Unfortunately the proposed method ignores such information. The performance improvement seems quite limited judging from the results.

The idea itself is simple but seems to be effective as shown in Tables 2 and 3.

What I’m missing here is a simple experiment to see the difference in accuracy performance between 1) when using PR for training the model (which is Case B in Table 2) against attacks versus 2) when not using PR for training the model against other attacks (similar to Table 2, Testing phase but using other attack models not PR as an attack model).

It is not quite clear to me why using PR as a defense mechanism helps the NN model.  I see its utility when training the NN model but using it as a defense mechanism is not quite clear why it works. 

Minor:
It is not quite clear how the author chose the hyperparameters, maybe by changing those hyperparameter the attacker could have much clever ways to attack the NN model.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1xTSS2t2m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Results are not convincing</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ez_sRcFQ&amp;noteId=H1xTSS2t2m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper presents a new adversarial defense method.  I found the paper difficult to understand, but as far as I understand, the method involves randomly perturbing the pixels of images in a dataset, and retraining the classifier to correctly classify these perturbed images as well.  The perturbations are done independently per pixel by quantizing the pixel value, and then using a perceptron model to generate the full pixel value from just this quantized value.  The perceptron is trained on randomly generated data mapping quantized pixel values to full pixel values (this random generation does not use the dataset statistics at all).  They use both partially converged perceptron models as well as fully converged perceptron models. 

Pros:
	1. The defense technique does not require knowledge of the attack method

Cons:
	1. The paper is incredibly difficult to understand due to the writing.
	2. The performed experiments are insufficient to determine  whether or not their technique works because:
		a. They don't compare against any other defense techniques.  In addition to at least adversarial training, I would like to also see comparisons to feature squeezing which I would expect to have a very similar effect.
		b. They do not show the results of an attack by an adversary that is aware of their technique.  (i.e. F(PR(A(F,PR,x))))  Many alternative defense techniques will work much better if we assume the adversary does not know about the technique.
		c. Their comparison against random noise is not an apples-to-apples comparison.  Instead of perturbing uniformly within a range, they perturb according to a normal distribution.  The random noise perturbations also have a much larger L2 distance than the perturbations from their technique.  To believe that their method is actually better than training with random noise I'd like to see an apples-to-apples comparison where these values are hyperparameter tuned as they presumably did for their method.
		d. They only show results for one value of epsilon and one value of "# of colors" for their technique.  Presumably if there is a mismatch between these values then the results will be much worse (i.e. if they choose a large "# of colors"/small range per color and the attacker chooses a large epsilon).
	3. Their use of machine learning models is quite ad-hoc.  In particular they use a perceptron trained on algorithmically generated data.  And their justification for using a perceptron, instead of just using the known underlying generation algorithm is that they also use a partially converged version of the perceptron as part of their model.
	4. The authors partly deanonymize the paper through a github link
	5. The main paper is 10 pages long, and the quality of the paper does not justify the additional length.

The algorithm is much more clear to me now.  I have one more follow up question:
	- What use does the perceptron provide? Why does the PR model need to be trained at all,  given that you can easily exactly the compute the underlying sampling process?  i.e. why not just discretize into one of the color bins (e.g. map 18 to class 1, since you know the range), and then randomly sample from the known range for class 1 to generate the output?

It is true that we can do the sampling directly as stated in your comments if the perceptron is fully converged and only one perceptron is used. However, as we have mentioned in Section 2.2, we generate multiple PR models. The PR models includes partially converged models and fully converged models. If we use the partially converged model to predict a pixel, we can predict the pixel into a different class from its original class. For example, a pixel origin from the class 1 but the model predicts it to class 3. The pixel will no longer be a black color pixel but it turns to a white color pixel. In summary, we use PR model to predict a pixel not only with the same class, but also with a different class.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rkgGbR3Nnm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>some clarifications  </a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ez_sRcFQ&amp;noteId=rkgGbR3Nnm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">30 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">I have some questions that needs to be clarified:
1) In Fig 3, you use perceptron to predict the value of the pixel, how to ensure that the outcome of the perceptron is within the normal range? What would be the case if the input is on the boundary (say close to .5 in graysclae case) then the outcome could be lower or higher than .5? 
2) "During the experiments, we set ε = 0.3 for the MNIST dataset and ε = 8/256 for the Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets when we apply with the FGSM, BIM, and MIM attacks" How do you justify for these hyper-parameter choices? 
3) In section 3.4, you explained multiple cases for different attack mechanisms. These cases for testing the CNN not for training them, right? In other words, do you assume that in the training phase the PR method was used? If this is the case, what is the benefit of using PR in the testing phase rather than attack, i.e. how could using PR in the testing be useful? 
4) In Figure 4, the adversarial images in both cases A and B should be the same, right? Why are they different? Unless by adversarial image you sometimes mean the outcome of the PR model as well. 
5) In Table 2, why is the accuracy performance on training phase less than the performance on both phases? I would expect that both phases is more challenges because in the test you introduce images with some additional variations. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SygrWEvH3m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Reply to "some clarifications"</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ez_sRcFQ&amp;noteId=SygrWEvH3m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">30 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thank you for your comments.

1. The outcome of the perceptron mostly will be within the normal range if the perceptron is converged. Since the perceptron will give only 1 output, then the outcome to change the pixel has to be based on the output of the perceptron.

2. We usually follow the default parameters on the scripts or we use the parameters that have been suggested from most related papers.

3. Yes, the cases in Section 3.4 are only used in the testing phase, after we have trained our model with PR method. In other words, we use PR method in all cases during the training phase except for Section 4.1 and 4.4. By using PR method, it can destroy adversarial pixels with some chances.

4. We would like to apologies with the caption of the table that we have used in current version and we would like to modify it in the next version to prevent the confusion. In Figure 4, we show PR(A(F,x)) images for Case A and A(F,x) images for Case B. 

5. We apologies that we cannot get this question fully. In Table 2, the accuracy performance on the training phase is higher than the performance in the both phases, mostly.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BylJ6uPJnm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>How do you limit CW distortion?</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ez_sRcFQ&amp;noteId=BylJ6uPJnm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">26 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Byu default, CW will minimize the distortion subject to the fact the image is adversarial.

To remove the confusion, we would like to rephrase the sentence from
"During the experiments, we set epsilon = 0.3 for MNIST dataset and 0.03 for Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets when we apply with FGSM, BIM, and MIM attacks." 
to
"During the experiments, when we apply with FGSM, BIM, and MIM attacks, we set epsilon = 0.3 for MNIST dataset and 0.03 for Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets."  in the next version. 
For the conclusion, we do not set the epsilon value in CW attack.

We only test CW with the L_2 based metric in this version.
Thanks to your comment, we would like to add the L_infinity test in our paper next version.

With an unbounded perturbation, you should always be able to cause a classifier to return the wrong output. You should instead be reporting the perturbation size.

That is, it is not helpful to report "CW success rate is 82%". Reporting "CW success rate is 82% with a mean successful perturbation of 3.2." is at least useful, but probably indicates the attack is somehow broken. Best is to report "Mean perturbation is 3.5 to generate an adversarial example."</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1g5N3R-2m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Reply to "For unbounded attacks, report distortion; not accuracy percentage"</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ez_sRcFQ&amp;noteId=H1g5N3R-2m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">27 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thank you for the comments.

As we have replied in "Reply to 'Why is this interesting?'" below, Case C is the case that the attackers have the knowledge of our defense technique. However, our defense technique increases the distortion of the adversarial image. Hence, we mentioned that Case C is impractical.

For the conclusion, we did test the attack techniques with the parameters of our defense technique (i.e. Case C).</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HkloUOwy2Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Do not understand Case C</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ez_sRcFQ&amp;noteId=HkloUOwy2Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">25 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Could you explain again what you mean by Case C?

For Case A and B, they are correct. For Case C, we classify F(A(F, PR(x))).

Although we classify F(A(F, PR(x))) for Case C, the results (the accuracy and the distance metric -- adversarial image) are similar to F(A(F, PR, x)).
We show Case C is because we want to evaluate the performance of our defense technique if our defense technique has exposed. Unfortunately, due to our defense technique, the adversarial image generated will have high distortion value. Therefore, we mentioned that Case C is impractical in our paper.
We will add the result of the classifications (i.e. F(A(F, PR, x)) and F(PR(A(F, PR, x)))) in the next version.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJxM4KJM2X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Still don't understand</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ez_sRcFQ&amp;noteId=rJxM4KJM2X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">27 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">I still don't see how this makes sense.

Assume that the attackers do not interest with the pre-processing
method, either the attackers have knowledge about the pre-processing
method (white-box attack) or not (grey-box attack), the results are
shown in Case A.
If the pre-processing method assigns an pixel with a random number,
the method can be defined as one of the following:
a) X_new = X_old + n
b) X_new = X_old * n
c) X_new = X_old * k + n
** X_new = f(X_old)

If the neural network is as follows:
y = (.)W+b
where (.) is the pre-processing method

If the attack technique is as follows:
X_adv = X_old + eps*sign(dL/dX_old)

If the scenario is given as above, the X_adv will produce the same
result for the (a) and (b) cases of the pre-processing method. The
X_adv may have slightly different in the (c) case of the
pre-processing method.
In summary, the attackers cannot do much with the pre-processing
method (e.g. randomness function) even they know the pre-processing
method.

On the other hand, if the attackers do want to deal with the
pre-processing method, Case C maybe needed since the attackers do not
want the adversarial pixels to be removed from the pre-processing
method. As far as our knowledge, no much attack techniques will deal
with the pre-processing method. This may be an open problem for
researchers to study how the attackers can deal with the
pre-processing method while maintaining the quality of the adversarial
image as good as the original image and the generated adversarial
image can fool the trained neural networks.

For case C,
the neural network and the attack technique are as follows:
y = (X_old -&gt; X_new)W+b
X_adv = X_new + eps*sign(dL/dX_new)

In the python script (tensorflow) that we have implemented, when we
apply the classification, F(A(F, PR, X)), where the attackers know all
the parameters of the neural network and PR method, the produced
results are similar as F(A(F, PR(X))).
We conjecture that the derivation of the "X_old -&gt; X_new" is hard to
be computed by the script, so, it has stopped at the "X_new" and
updated the "X_new" as the adversarial image.

We show Case C is also to evaluate the performance of the attack
technique and defense technique. From Case C, it showed that attack
technique can intrude the defense technique easily but it caused the
high distortion of the image</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJg0P3Z4hm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Question remains</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ez_sRcFQ&amp;noteId=BJg0P3Z4hm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">29 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thank you for your reply. However I don't think this answers my original question.

You say that one of the cases you study is F(A(F, PR(x))). I do not understand why that case is ever interesting.

Can you please give an example where (1) the PR method transforms an input x, (2) the attacker modifies the output of the PR() method, and (3) the result of that is then classified by F?

I can not think of a reason why this case is useful. It doesn't make sense why the attacker should be allowed to take their turn in between running PR() and F()</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1gV0TM4nX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Reply to "Question remains"</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ez_sRcFQ&amp;noteId=r1gV0TM4nX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">29 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thank you for your comments.

The example for each query is shown as follows:
Assume that X is an image, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n is the pixels of the image.
(1) For a pixel, x_1 = 20, PR method will transform x_1 to any random value, for example, 28.
(2) The attacker will use x_1 = 28 to generate a new value, maybe x_1 has changed to 26.
(3) The simple linear equation for predicting the adversarial image is
    y = x_1*w_1 + x_2*w_2 + ... + x_n * w_n
      = 26*w_1 + x_2*w_2 + ... + x_n * w_n

Basically, Case C  is interesting to show the attack techniques have to generate an adversarial image from the transformed image (after the pre-processing method) in order to fool the neural network effectively.
In other words, this scenario is equivalent to the neural network has no any defense mechanism.

Summary: 
For Case A, attackers generate A(F, x), neural network uses PR(.) to defend.
For Case B, attackers generate A(F, x), neural network uses no defense mechanism.
For Case C, attackers generate A(F, PR(x)), neural network uses no defense mechanism.
If there is Case D (F(PR(A(F, PR, x)))), attackers generate A(F, PR(x)), neural networks uses PR(.) to defend.

This Case C is also very interesting because Case C can be considered as an insider attack or insider threat which is very crucial in cyber-security.

The attacker can intrude the system and perform deception attack after the image is pre-processed.
Actually, in view of computer security, the scenario like the case C is very important.
The attacker can intrude the system, place himself in the middle of the "pre-processing --- classification" pipeline, try to perform deception attack.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BkxLLnoE27" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Case C: Unreasonable threat model + incorrect evaluation</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ez_sRcFQ&amp;noteId=BkxLLnoE27"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">29 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Now that I believe I completely understand what you are saying, I will make one final comment here.

The threat model you study in Case C has no basis in reality. On at least three levels, the evaluation of this case is fundamentally flawed.

To begin, this case has nothing to do with insider threats, yes, insider attacks are definitely important. However, insider threats have *nothing* to do with this Case C threat model. If the attacker could somehow perturb an input in between the PR and the F function calls, they could almost certainly do much, much worse. As just a short list of things the attacker could do instead:
- Modify the PR function to make it an effective no-op but still make changes to the input so it "looks" like it is doing the right thing.
- Modify the F function to make it output the incorrect predictions by making subtle modifications to the weights.
- Make unrestricted changes to the input x before it is passed to the neural network F.

But fine, let's assume for some reason the only thing the adversary is allowed to do is modify the image PR(x) and they have to make a small perturbation. Even still, the way that you qualitatively measure this attack is wrong. Of course "perturbed pixels from the adversarial image can be perceptible by the human." when looking at A(F,PR(x)) Why? Because PR(x) introduces a very large distortion to begin with! And so even the attacker was just the function F(x) = x, it still appear to have a high distortion.

Okay, so even with that out of the way, the attack doesn't even seem to be implemented correctly. The claimed model accuracy at eps=0.3 is ~40% on MNIST, on the images that have been already modified by PR. Recall that in this case, as you say, there is nothing standing in the way of the attacker. The result of the attacker will be fed *directly* into the classification neural network. Because the un-protected neural network has accuracy 0% at eps=0.3, the attacker in Case C should be able to achieve this same result. (Worse yet: it should be even *easier*. They receive as input images that are already noisy.)</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJeK6XvBnQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Reply to "Case C: Unreasonable threat model + incorrect evaluation"</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ez_sRcFQ&amp;noteId=HJeK6XvBnQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">30 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper334 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thank you for your comments.

We appreciate your comments and we will take your opinions into account in the future.

However, we have to clarify that we are not solving the insider threats problem in Case C. We mentioned the insider threats only for a scenario example to the readers, so they could have better understanding.

Furthermore, we agree that the attacker will receive a very high distortion for generating an adversarial image in Case C due to the PR method.  If we compute |PR(x) - A(F, PR(x))|, the distortion is low and the distortion is high when we compute |x - A(F, PR(x))|. Due to the limitation of the state-of-the-art attacks that we have known, which the attackers have weak ability to deal with the pre-processing method, we show Case C as it is. As aforementioned, the purpose of studying Case C is just to show the attackers have to generate A(F, PR(x)) in order to fool the neural network effectively until we find a proper attack for it. This case also could raise the awareness of the attackers to deal something with the pre-processing method but not only with the neural network itself.

We claimed that our model can achieve accuracy ~40% at eps=0.3 is because we have trained our model with distorted images (not with clean images) which increased the robustness of the model. This performance can be claimed from the case when the model has trained with the adversarial training which the trained model can maintain a very high performance even the trained model is attacked by the same attack technique (or weaker than the used attack technique) that has used during the adversarial training.
As we have mentioned in the paper, our method is similar to the adversarial training. But, the difference is that the adversarial training uses adversarial images as the training images, whereas our method uses distorted images (may have some chances to generate adversarial images) as the training images. In addition, our method will pre-process the image. Readers can think as our PR method has double defense mechanisms.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
