In this paper, we present a novel natural image benchmark for making this extension, which we call CIFAR10H. This new dataset comprises a human-derived, full distribution over labels for each image of the CIFAR10 test set, offering the ability to assess the generalization of state-of-the-art CIFAR10 models, as well as investigate the effects of including this information in model training. We show that classification models trained on CIFAR10 do not generalize as well to our dataset as it does to traditional extensions, and that models fine-tuned using our label information are able to generalize better to related datasets, complement popular data augmentation schemes, and provide robustness to adversarial attacks. We explain these improvements in terms of better empirical approximations to the expected loss function over natural images and their categories in the visual world.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">image classification, human experiments, risk minimization</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">improving classifiers using human uncertainty measurements</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">6 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SJgtofrqnm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting idea, but the empirical investigation seems lacking</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJl8BhRqF7&amp;noteId=SJgtofrqnm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1545 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1545 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors create a new dataset with label distributions (rather than one-hot annotations) for the CIFAR-10 test set. They then study the effect of fine-tuning using this dataset on the generalization performance of SOTA deep networks. They also study the effects on adversarial robustness.

I think that datasets such as the one generated in this paper could indeed be a valuable testbed to study deep network generalization and robustness. There are many nice benefits of label distributions over one hot labels (that the authors summarize in Section 2.) The paper is also clear and well-written. 

That being said, I do not find the investigation of this paper completely satisfactory. For instance in the generalization experiments, the numbers presented seem to show some interesting (and somewhat surprising) trends, however the authors do not really pursue these or provide any insight as to why this is the case. I also find the section on robustness very weak.

Detailed comments:

- The theoretical contribution mentioned in the appendix does not really seem to be a contribution - it is just a simple derivation of the loss under label distributions. Theoretical contributions are not necessary for a paper to have merit - the authors should remove this statement from the introduction as it detracts from the value of the paper.

- I find it somewhat surprising that the accuracy of the models does not change on training with Cifar10H. Do the authors have any intuition as to why this is the case? The model cross entropy seems to go down, indicating that probability assigned to the correct class increases. I would think that training with label distributions would actually reduce misclassification on confusing instances. It would be interesting to see how the logit distributions change for different examples. For instance, how does the model confidence change on correctly vs wrongly classified examples?

- The authors mention that they run each hyperparameter configuration for three random seeds. It would be nice then to see error bars for the results reported Tables 1 and 2, particularly because the differences in accuracy are small. Did the authors try different train-test splits of the test set? It would also be helpful if the authors could make plots for the results in these tables (at least in the appendix). It is hard to compare numbers across different tables.

-I find the results in Table 2 confusing. Comparing the numbers to Table 1, it seems that mixup does not really change accuracies/loss. The model names in Table 2 do not exactly match Table 1 so it is hard to identify the additional gain from using mixup that the authors mention. The authors should add plots for these results to illustrate the effect of adding mixup more clearly.

-I am not convinced by the section on robustness. Firstly, it is not clear to me why the authors chose FGSM which is known to be a somewhat simple attack to illustrate improved robustness of their model. To perform a useful study of robustness, the authors should study SOTA attacks such as PGD [Madry et al., 2017]. I also do not understand the claim that the top-1 choice becomes less confident after training with CIFAR10H -- this seems to be contradicted by the fact that the cross entropy loss goes down. The authors should provide supporting evidence for this claim by looking at changes in confidence (see point 3 above). Also, the comment about the trade-off between accuracy and robustness seems vague - could the authors clarify what they mean?

Overall, I like the premise of this paper and agree that with the potential benefits of the dataset generated. However, I think that the current experiments are not strong enough to corroborate this.

This idea is sound and should improve performance.

Unfortunately this work lacks novelty and isn't clearly presented.
(1) Throughout the paper, there are turns that used without definition prior to use, all table headers in table 1. 
(2) Results are hard to interpret in the tables, and there are limited details. Mixup for example, doesn't provide exact parameters, but only mentions that its a convex sum.
(3) There is no theoretical justification for the approach.
(4) This approach isn't scalable past small datasets, which the authors acknowledge. 
(6) This has been already done. In the discussion the authors bring up two potential directions of work:
   (a) providing a distribution over classes by another model - &gt; this is distillation (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531)</a>
   (b) adding a source of relationships between classes into the objective function -&gt; this is (https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/42854.pdf)

They use it to improve the calibration of several image classifiers through “fine-tuning” and other techniques
The title is too general, taking into account that this setting has appeared in classification in many domains, with different names (learning from class distributions, crowd labellers, learning from class scores, etc.). See for instance,
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3994863/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3994863/</a>
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~atn/nguyen-hcomp15.pdf 
Also, at the end of section 2 we simply reach logloss, which is a traditional way of evaluating the calibration of a classifier, but other options exist, such as the Brier score. At times, the authors mention the trade-off between classification accuracy and cross-entropy. This sounds very much the trade-off between refinement and calibration, as one of the possible decompositions of the Brier score.
The authors highlight the limitations of this work, and they usually mention that the problem must be difficult (e.g., low resolution). Otherwise, humans are too good to be useful. I suggest the authors to compare with psychophysics and possible distortions of the images, or time limits for doing the classifications. 
Nevertheless, the paper is not well motivated, and the key procedures, such as “fine-tuning” lack detail, and comparison with other options.
In section 2, which is generally good and straightforward, we find that p(x|c) being non-overlapping as a situation where uncertainty would be not justified. Overlap would simply say that it is a categorisation (multilabel classification) problem rather than a classification problem, but this is different from the situation where labels are soft or given by several users. 
In the end, the paper is presented from the perspective of image recognition, but it should be compared with many other areas in classification evaluation where different metrics, presentation of the data, levels of uncertainty, etc., are used, including different calibration methods, as alternatives to the expensive method presented here based on crowd labelling.
Pros:
-	More information about borderline cases may be useful for learning. This new dataset seems to capture this information.
Cons:
-	The extra labelling is very costly, as the authors recognise.
-	The task is known in the classification literature, and a proper comparison with other approaches is required.
-	Not compared with calibration approaches or other ways where boundaries can be softened with less information from human experts. For instance, a cost matrix about how critical a misclassification is considered by humans (cat &lt;-&gt; dog, versus cat &lt;-&gt; car) could also be very useful, and much easier to obtain.
