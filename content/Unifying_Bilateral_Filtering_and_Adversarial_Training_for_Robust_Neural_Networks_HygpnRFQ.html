Many effective algorithms exist to craft these adversarial examples, but performant defenses seem to be far away. In this work,  we explore the use of edge-aware bilateral filtering as a projection back to the space of natural images. We show that bilateral filtering is an effective defense in multiple attack settings, where the strength of the adversary gradually increases. In the case of adversary who has no knowledge of the defense, bilateral filtering can remove more than 90% of adversarial examples from a variety of different attacks. To evaluate against an adversary with complete knowledge of our defense, we adapt the bilateral filter as a trainable layer in a neural network and show that adding this layer makes ImageNet images significantly more robust to attacks. When trained under a framework of adversarial training, we show that the resulting model is hard to fool with even the best attack methods. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Adversarial examples, Image denoising</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We adapt bilateral filtering as a layer in a neural network which improves robustness to adversarial examples using nonlocal filtering.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">15 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1lSIkGThQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An interesting idea, but not good enough.

Bilateral Filtering (BF) is a smoothening technique that averages pixels that are close to each other both in position and value. As a result BF preserves sharp edges and the denoised images appear to be of higher quality than those produces via simple Gaussian smoothing.
First, the method is evaluated on black-box attacks by constructing AE for the undefended network and then applying the defense. The method is then tested on white-box attacks which attack the defended system end-to-end with first order methods. Finally, the authors propose combining their defense with adversarial training.

Overall, I find the main idea of the paper interesting. BF seems like a natural approach to remove low-magnitude perturbations from the image while preserving the salient characteristics of the image. Thus, if it did not hurt classification accuracy significantly it might be considered as part of a cheap preprocessing pipeline that protects the model from simple attacks. However, as shown in Table 3 and 6, BF reduces the accuracy of the original model by at least 5% on ImageNet and CIFAR10.

My main objection about the paper is that BF is proposed as a defense that is extremely robust against even the best attacks. However, the evaluation is clearly incomplete for such a claim and fails to pass simple sanity checks.

*Epsilon values used to claim robustness are way too high*. Table 4 reports an L_infinity bound of 0.793 (almost 40% the image range) and L_2 of 187 (again roughly a quarter of the L2 radius of the image domain). One can change the class of the image completely (even for humans) with a smaller epsilon bound. This is a very clear indication that the attacks used are not sufficient to properly evaluate the robustness of the defense. Even in the images produced by the authors (Figure 2) it is clear that these perturbations are sufficient in terms of magnitude to completely distort the image.

*Only first-order attacks are considered*. From the point about epsilon values above, it is fairly clear that the defense is not easy to attack with first-order methods. This is understandable since BF, even if "fully differentiable", will lead to vanishing gradients for certain pixels. I think it is necessary that the authors to evaluate their defense on other attacks such as a) a straight-through approximation of BF (see BPDA from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00420)," target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00420),</a> b) a finite-differences-based attack (see SPSA from https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05666). As a sanity check, I would even recommend evaluating using the nearest neighbor of each image from a wrong class. It is clear that this attack will always succeed and the L_p distance will be smaller than those reported here.

I believe that these are fundamental issues about the paper that need to be addressed before even considering the paper for acceptance and I thus recommend rejection at this time.

Other comments and concerns:
--Table 6: what is the performance of BFNet without adversarial training? This is a necessary baseline to understand the results of the table.

-- I am confused by the adaptation of adversarial training to BFNet (last equation of section 3.4). The equations themselves are confusing since x is used twice (as a parameter to f and sampled from D). My first guess would be that the method is performing end-to-end adversarial training from the loss to the input x (before BF). It appears however that adversarial training is performed with respect to the image *after* applying the BF filter. If this is the case, it goes against the fundamental principles of adversarial training.

-- I do not see the point of adaptive filtering (AF) as a defense. BF is attractive because it is simple. Adding a classifier to figure out the right parameters seems dubious at best. The idea seems fundamentally flawed given that the classifier is only trained on known attacks and might thus not capture new, different attacks. Lastly, since the classifier is a ML model, it will clearly be susceptible to adversarial perturbations. So the adversary can choose an attack that fools the original model and forces the classifier to choose bad BF parameters. I would suggest that the authors completely remove AF from future versions of their paper.

-- The performance on ImageNet is significantly better than the performance on MNIST and CIFAR10. This is counter-intuitive since a much harder dataset both from a standard and adversarial point of view.

Minor comments to authors:
-- A JPEG compression-based defense can be bypassed (https://machine-learning-and-security.github.io/papers/mlsec17_paper_54.pdf).
-- Last paragraph of page 3 is too informal ("less holes for adversarials to maneuver on").
-- Top of page 4: you seem to confuse "iterative methods" with "small magnitude" attacks. One can use iterative attacks to create large adversarial perturbations (e.g. PGD).
-- I would suggest normalizing to the more common [0, 1] range as the current numbers can be confusing.
-- I am confused by Tables 2, 3. First row of Table 2 shows that on 95% of the clean inputs the label is not changed after BF. But table 3 shows that the accuracy drop from 78.8% to 71.7%. What is going on here?
-- Last part of first paragraph of 4.2 is hard to understand.
-- End of page 8, "the higher dimensionality of CIFAR10 makes it harder than MNIST". Yet the paper claims excellent performance on ImageNet.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SkeO-wwcnQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>The paper is well written, however some experimental results are incomplete/unclear and discussion is lacking</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hygp1nR9FQ&amp;noteId=SkeO-wwcnQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1025 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1025 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">1. The numbers in Table 1 should be compared with the %-age of examples that were actually fooled to begin with by using each adversarial attack scheme under study. Only then can the recovery performance of the hand-tuned bilateral filtering be put into perspective.
2. In case of the adaptive filtering method, the parameters for bilateral filtering are predicted by a standalone classifier. For the experiments to be fair, any incoming image, whether adversarially perturbed or not, must be filtered using the parameters predicted by the classifier. Thus, are the results in the column titled 'clean' pertaining to when natural (unperturbed images) are filtered and tested? If not, then what are the accuracy values in that case.
3. Also in Table 2, the case (B) measures the ability of the adaptive filtering to change the predicted label from the adversarial label to a 'new' one.  In this case, it is important to measure/verify whether the 'new' label is benign or malignant (which may well depend on the specific task of classification and the semantic associations of the output classes). Without this analysis for the 'new' class, it seems irrelevant and even misleading to quote this measure.
4. It is unclear what the relation between the results in Table 2 and Table 3 is. How are the values in the two tables linked, if at all?
5. In Table 3., once again, what does 'clean' column report? Are the natural images adaptively filtered and then tested for accuracy? If not, then do also report those numbers in a separate column. 
6. It is really evident in Table 3 that as the adaptive filtering is applied and the robustness seems to improve (as measured in terms of the accuracy figures for the various attack schemes), the accuracy for natural/clean images consistently and significantly drops. There has not been discussed anywhere in the paper. What does this imply? It should be highlighted in text and maybe even graphically, plotting the tradeoff between robustness gain (on adversarial images) and accuracy loss (on clean images). 
7. Some claims in the paper are unsubstantiated: (a) 2nd para, pg 7 - an adversarial detector or a human eye would be able to detect those attacks. Do the authors have any quantitative figures to share on how well a detector or human subjects would fare at this task? (b) Larger perturbations are visually discernible and thus less adversarial? Again, from the images in row 2, fig2, one can notice that there is a higher quotient of noise but this doesn't in any way interfere with the recognisability of those images by a human. How are they less adversarial when humans are not affected by the perturbations as concerns the classification task?
8. What does the column title 'natural' in Table 5 correspond to, especially as it is a subcolumn of an attack scheme? Also, the numbers in Table 5 seem to be the fooling rates. This is inconsistent with the remaining tables where accuracies are being presented. Do you think it would be better to convert these to accuracy figures too?

I am interested in knowing the authors' responses on the above points before I can propose my final rating.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1lkHf8U37" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Distortion and Obfuscated Gradients</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hygp1nR9FQ&amp;noteId=r1lkHf8U37"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1025 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">31 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1025 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper addresses the robustness of deep neural networks to adversarial example attacks. It uses a bilateral filtering as a preprocessing step to recover clean data from adversarial ones. It can also get combined with adversarial training and be trained end-to-end. The paper is well written, the background and introduction is clear. However I have comments about their implementation and experimental results:

1. They are claiming to have a very high distortion while their model can still perform well.  They have to make sure obfuscated gradients has not happened and they have implemented the back-propagation from attack to defense correctly. 

2. Also if they had consider black-box threats as well as white-box one, it would have been more informative of how their method actually performs. Specially, in order to check whether obfuscated gradients has happened, the black-box threats are better choice, which they have not tried.  

So considering the above, there might be an issue in what they are claiming, so they might reconsider their method. Maybe reviewing their codes by some experts in this topic can give a good evaluation. 

(I have to mention that I am not an expert in Adversarial networks)

Please consider carefully evaluating the claims you have made.

We normalized the images to the range [-1, 1] (we mention this in section 4.1) instead of [0, 1]. We did this because we used the Cleverhans library to generate adversarial examples, and most pre-trained TensorFlow models accept data in the [-1, 1] range. Here an epsilon value of 0.5 is only 25% of the effective range. Our method indeed sees degraded performance as the perturbation magnitude approaches 1.0 (half the effective range). At epsilon = 1.0, we expect to see the attack succeed because it destroys the image. Indeed this happens with FGSM, and to a lesser degree, MI-FGSM. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJeTuHSBnm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Cleverhans normalizes images to the range [0, 1]</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hygp1nR9FQ&amp;noteId=BJeTuHSBnm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">30 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1025 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">In the Cleverhans tutorial code[1], images are normalized to the range [0, 1], not the range [-1, 1].

In your paper, the claim about white-box "This is categorically more difficult than black-box threat models where the attacker has little or no knowledge about the model or training data" may not be true. If a model causes obfuscated gradients, black-box attacks perform better than white-box attacks (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00420)." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00420).</a> How do you make sure if your model does not cause obfuscated gradients?</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Syg4xYfCiQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>White box attacks are still more powerful</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hygp1nR9FQ&amp;noteId=Syg4xYfCiQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">25 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1025 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">White box attacks have strictly more information available to them and therefore are more powerful by definition.

The problem is that with gradient masking even though more information should only help, sometimes it hurt (indicating that the attack is performing sub-optimally). So it makes sense to run both white-box and black-box attacks and verify the white-box attacks do better.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
