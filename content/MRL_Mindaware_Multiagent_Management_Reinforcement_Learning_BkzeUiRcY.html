In this paper, we aim to address this from a different angle. In particular, we consider scenarios where there are self-interested agents (i.e., worker agents) which have their own minds (preferences, intentions, skills, etc.) and can not be dictated to perform tasks they do not wish to do. For achieving optimal coordination among these agents, we train a super agent (i.e., the manager) to manage them by first inferring their minds based on both current and past observations and then initiating contracts to assign suitable tasks to workers and promise to reward them with corresponding bonuses so that they will agree to work together. The objective of the manager is maximizing the overall productivity as well as minimizing payments made to the workers for ad-hoc worker teaming. To train the manager, we propose Mind-aware Multi-agent Management Reinforcement Learning (M^3RL), which consists of agent modeling and policy learning. We have evaluated our approach in two environments,  Resource Collection and Crafting, to simulate multi-agent management problems with various task settings and multiple designs for the worker agents. The experimental results have validated the effectiveness of our approach in modeling worker agents' minds online, and in achieving optimal ad-hoc teaming with good generalization and fast adaptation.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We propose Mind-aware Multi-agent Management Reinforcement Learning (M^3RL) for training a manager to motivate self-interested workers to achieve optimal collaboration by assigning suitable contracts to them.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SyggSiwZp7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Multi agent RL with self interesting agents: New formulation and solution in simple environments.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkzeUiRcY7&amp;noteId=SyggSiwZp7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper146 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">08 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper146 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary:

This paper proposes a way to train a manager agent which would manage a bunch of worker agents to achieve a high-level goal. Each worker has its own set of skills and preferences and the manager tries to assign sub-tasks to these agents along with bonuses such that the agents can even perform tasks that are not preferred by them. Authors achieve this by training a manager which tracks the skills and preferences of the agents on the fly. Authors have done an extensive analysis of the proposed approach in two simple domains: resource collection and crafting.

Major comments:

This paper focuses on multi-agent settings with self-interested agents. The problem formulation and the solution are novel enough. Experiments are on toy domains with very few goals and sub-task dependencies. However, authors have done a good job in doing an extensive analysis of the proposed approach.

1.	Can you comment about the scalability of the proposed solution when the number of possible subtasks increases? When the sub-task dependency graph size increases?

2.	What is the reason for using rule-based agents in all the experiments? It would have been more useful if all the analysis are done with RL agents rather than rule-based agents. It would also make the paper stronger.

3.	Are the authors willing to release the code? Overall the model looks complicated and the appendix is not sufficient to reproduce the results in the paper. I would increase my rating if the authors are willing to release the code to reproduce all the results reported in the paper.


Minor comments:

1.	Page 3, line 9: “typical” -&gt; “typically”
2.	Page 3, “intention” section: “Based on the its reward ..” Check grammar.
3.	Page 5, last line: “the total quantitative is 10” check grammar.
4.	Page 8, conclusions, second line: “nad” -&gt; “and”
5.	Page 8, conclusions, 4th line: “combing” -&gt; “combine”

This paper studies the problem of generating contracts by a principal to incentive agents to optimally accomplish multiagent tasks. The setup of the environment is that the agents have certain skills and preferences for activities, which the principal must learn to act optimally. The paper takes a combined approach of agent modeling to infer agent skills and preferences, and a deep reinforcement learning approach to generate contracts. The evaluation of the approach is fairly thorough.

The main novel contribution of the paper is to introduce the principal-agent problem to the deep multiagent reinforcement learning literature.

My concerns are:
- The paper should perform a literature search on related work from operations research, including especially principal-agent problems, which are not currently surveyed, and perhaps also optimal scheduling problems.
- How do the problems introduced either map onto real applications or map onto environments studied in existing literature (such as in operations research)?
- More details should be given on the mind tracker module.
- Is it necessary to use deep reinforcement learning for contract generation?  If the agent modeling is good, the optimal contracts look like they are probably simple to compute directly in the environments studied.

Overall, the paper is somewhat interesting and relatively technically sound, but the contribution seems marginal. The problems studied seem pulled out a hat, when they could be situated in specific existing literature.

The algorithm designer is a manager who can assign goals to various agents but cannot see their valuation or control them explicitly. The manager has a utility function for various goals and wants to maximize the total revenue. The abstract problem is well-motivated and significant and is an entire branch of study called algorithmic mechanism design. However often many assumptions have to be made to make the problem mathematically tractable. In this paper, the authors take an empirical approach by designing an RL framework that efficiently maximizes rewards across many episodes. Overall I find the problem interesting, well-motivated. The paper is well-written and contains significant experiments to support its point. However, I do not have the necessary background in the related literature to assess the significance of the methods proposed compared to prior work and thus would refrain from making a judgment on the novelty of this paper in terms of methodology. Here are some of my comments/questions to the author on this paper.


(1) I want to clarify how the skills of the agents play a role in the problem setup. Does it show up in the expression for the manager's reward? In particular, does it affect the Indicator for whether a goal is completed Eq. (2) via a process that need not be explicitly modeled but can be observed via a feedback of whether or not the goal is completed? So in the case of resource collection example, the skill set is a binary value for each resource, whether it can be collected or not? 

(2) Related to the first point, the motivation for modeling the agents as maximizing their utility is the assumption that agents do not know their skills. I am wondering, is this really justified? Over the course of episodes, can the agents learn their skills based on the relationship between their intention and the goals they achieve? In the resource collection example, when they reach a resource and are not able to collect it, they understand that they do not have the corresponding skill. Is there a way to extrapolate the results from this paper to such a setting? 

(3) I am slightly concerned about the sample complexity of keeping track of the probability of worker i finishing goal g within t steps with a bonus b. This scales linearly in parameters which usually would be large (such as the number of time-steps). Are there alternate ways to overcome maintaining the UCB explicitly, especially for the number of time-steps? 

Some minor comments on the presentation.

(1) What are the units for rewards in the plots? Is it the average per episode reward? It would be good to mention this in the caption.

(2) There are a few typos in the paper. Some I could catch was,

- Last line in Page 5: "quantitative" -&gt; "quantity"
- Page 8: skills nad preferences -&gt; skills and preferences
- Page 8: For which we combining -&gt; for which we combine</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
