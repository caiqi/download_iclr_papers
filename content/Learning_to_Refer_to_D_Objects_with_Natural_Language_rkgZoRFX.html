When people see an object, they represent it not as a pixel array but as a meaningful arrangement of semantic parts. Moreover, when people refer to an object, they provide descriptions that are not merely true but also relevant in the current context. Here, we combine these two observations in order to learn fine-grained correspondences between language and contextually relevant geometric properties of 3D objects. To do this, we employed an interactive communication task with human participants to construct a large dataset containing natural utterances referring to 3D objects from ShapeNet in a wide variety of contexts. Using this dataset, we developed neural listener and speaker models with strong capacity for generalization. By performing targeted lesions of visual and linguistic input, we discovered that the neural listener depends heavily on part-related words and associates these words correctly with the corresponding geometric properties of objects, suggesting that it has learned task-relevant structure linking the two input modalities. We further show that a neural speaker that is `listener-aware' --- that plans its utterances according to how an imagined listener would interpret its words in context --- produces more discriminative referring expressions than an `listener-unaware' speaker, as measured by human performance in identifying the correct object.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Referential Language, 3D Objects, Part-Awareness, Neural Speakers, Neural Listeners</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">How to build neural-speakers/listeners that learn fine-grained characteristics of 3D objects, from referential language.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rkgk-fZ63X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Well executed paper, however weak contributions</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkgZ3oR9FX&amp;noteId=rkgk-fZ63X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper684 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper684 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper studies the problem of how to refer to 3D objects with natural language. It collects a dataset for the same, by setting up a reference game between two people. It then trains speaker and listener models that learn how to describe a shape, and how to identify shapes given a discriminative referring expression. The paper seems to follows state-of-the-art in the design of these models, and investigates different choices for encoding the image / 3D shape, use if attention in the listener, and context and listener aware models.

Strengths:
1. Overall, I think this is a very well executed paper. It collects a dataset for studying the problem of interest, trains state-of-the-art models for the tasks, and conducts interesting ablations and tests insightful hypothesis.

Weaknesses
1. I am not sure what is the technical contribution being made in the paper? Contrastive referential expressions have been used to collect datasets for referring to objects in images. Use of listeners and speakers have been used in NLP (Andreas et al.) as well as in vision and language (Fried et al.). Thus, while I like the application, I am not sure if there is any novel contributions being made in the paper.

Overall, this is a well executed paper, however I am not sure about the novelty of contributions made in the paper.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BygDtFc9nQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>an interesting and creative paper</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkgZ3oR9FX&amp;noteId=BygDtFc9nQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper684 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper684 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper investigates how chairs are being described "in the context of other similar or not-so-similar chairs", by humans and neural networks. Humans perceive an object's structure, and use it to describe the differences to other objects "in context". The authors collected a corresponding "chairs in context" corpus, and build models that can describe the "target" chair, that can be used to retrieve the described object, and that can create more discriminative language if given information about the listener.

The paper is well written, in particular the appendix is very informative. The work seems novel in combination with the dataset, and an interesting and well executed study with interesting analysis that is very relevant to both situated natural language understanding and language generation. The "3D" aspect is a bit weak, given that all chairs seem to have essentially been pictured in very similar positions.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Ske3XSpdhm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Paper review</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkgZ3oR9FX&amp;noteId=Ske3XSpdhm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper684 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper684 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors provide a study on learning to refer to 3D objects. The authors collect a dataset of referential expressions and train several models by experimenting with a number of architectural choices.

This is an interesting study reporting results on the effect that several architectural choices have generating referential expressions. Overall, while I appreciate all the experiments and results, I don't really feel I've learned something from this paper. 

First and foremost, the paper, from the title already starts to build up expectations about the 3d nature of the study, however this is pretty much ignored at the rest of the paper. I would expect the paper to provide  some results and insights regarding the 3D nature of the dataset and how this affects referential expressions, however, there is no experiment that has used this 3d-ness in any way. Even the representations of the objects are stripped down to essentially 2D (a single-view of a 3D object used to derived VGG features is as 3D as any image dataset used for similar studies, right?). 
My major question is then: why should all this research take place in a 3D dataset? Is it to validate that research like this is at all possible with 3D objects? 

Moreover, all interesting aspects of referential expressions are stripped out since the authors experiment only with this geometric visual property (which has again nothing to do with 3d-ness, you could totally get that out of images). An interesting study would be to have all objects in the same image and have referential expressions that have to do with spatial expressions, something that the depth or a different view of the of the object could play a role.

Given the fact that there are no technical innovations, I can't vouch for accepting this paper, since there has been quite a lot of research on generating  referential expressions on image datasets (e.g., Kazemzadeh., 2014 and related papers). However, learning to refer to 3D objects is a very interesting topic, and of great importance given the growing interest of training agents in 3D virtual environments, and I would really encourage the authors to embrace the 3d-ness of objects and design studies that highlight the challenges and opportunities that the third dimension brings.
