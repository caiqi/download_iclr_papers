We present Amortized Proximal Optimization, which takes the perspective that each optimization step should approximately minimize a proximal objective (similar to the ones used to motivate natural gradient and trust region policy optimization). Optimization hyperparameters are adapted to best minimize the proximal objective after one weight update. We show that an idealized version of APO (where an oracle minimizes the proximal objective exactly) achieves second-order convergence rates for neural networks. APO incurs minimal computational overhead. We experiment with using APO to adapt a variety of optimization hyperparameters online during training, including (possibly layer-specific) learning rates, damping coefficients, and gradient variance exponents. For a variety of network architectures and optimization algorithms (including SGD, RMSprop, and K-FAC), we show that with minimal tuning, APO performs competitively with carefully tuned optimizers.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">hyperparameters, optimization, learning rate adaptation</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We introduce amortized proximal optimization (APO), a method to adapt a variety of optimization hyperparameters online during training, including learning rates, damping coefficients, and gradient variance exponents.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SylicetE67" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Concerns about experiments (more experiments need to be done!)</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJl6M2C5Y7&amp;noteId=SylicetE67"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">11 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1307 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Hi,

I have several questions about the experiments:

- How does APO compare to standard learning rate decay schedule (e.g., decay lr with a factor of 10 in the middle of training)?
- The reported numbers in terms of test performance on CIFAR-10 (~90%) and CIFAR-100 (~65%) are lower than my expectation. As I know, VGG16 can easily get &gt;70% on CIFAR-100 with BN and data augmentation. Besides, I suggest the authors focusing on CIFAR-100, rather than CIFAR-10 and MNIST (too easy).
- Can you show more experiments for K-FAC since you mentioned K-FAC in abstract and introduction? The experiments of K-FAC on MNIST is far from convincing, you should at least show some experiments on CIFAR. Also, you mentioned in 5.3 that K-FAC-APO first decreases the damping, then gradually increases the damping later in the training. Does it really make sense? As argued by the original K-FAC paper, the damping would diminish later in the training since the quadratic approximation is accurate enough.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1labrqphm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting and Novel contribution - Some concerns that need to be answered regarding experiments and theory</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJl6M2C5Y7&amp;noteId=r1labrqphm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1307 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1307 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary:
This paper introduces Amortized Proximal Optimization (APO) that optimizes a proximal objective at each optimization step. The optimization hyperparameters are optimized to best minimize the proximal objective. 

The objective is represented using a regularization style parameter lambda and a distance metric D that, depending on its definition, reduces the optimization procedure to Gauss-Newton, General Gauss Newton or Natural Gradient Descent.

There are two key convergence results which are dependent on the meta-objective being optimized directly which, while not practical, gives some insight into the inner workings of the algorithm. The first result indicates strong convergence when using the Euclidean distance as the distance measure D. The second result shows strong convergence when D is set as the Bregman divergence. 

The algorithm optimizes the base optimizer on a number of domains and shows state-of-the-art results over a grid search of the hyperparameters on the same optimizer.


Clarity and Quality: The paper is well written. 

Originality: It appears to be a novel application of meta-learning. I wonder why the authors didn’t compare or mention optimizers such as ADAM and ADAGRAD which adapt their parameters on-the-fly as well. Also how does this compare to adaptive hyperparameter training techniques such as population based training?

Significance:
Overall it appears to be a novel and interesting contribution. I am concerned though why the authors didn’t compare to adaptive optimizers such as ADAM and ADAGRAD and how the performance compares with population based training techniques. Also, your convergence results appear to rely on strong convexity of the loss. How is this a reasonable assumption? These are my major concerns. 

Question: In your experiments, you set the learning rate to be really low. What happens if you set it to be arbitrarily high? Can you algorithm recover good learning rates?

When learning rates are in focus, a convincing message would be to show that adaptation of learning rates is more efficient and simpler than their scheduling when tested on state-of-the-art architectures. 
A. You demonstrate the results on CIFAR-10 for 10% error rates which corresponds to networks which are far from what is currently used in deep learning. Thus, it is hard to say whether the results are applicable in practice. 
B. You don't schedule learning rates for your baseline methods except for a single experiment for some initial learning rate. 
C. Your method involves a hyperparameter to be tuned which affects the shape of the schedule. This hyperparameter itself benefits from (requires?) some scheduling. 

It would be interesting to see if the proposed method is competitive for training contemporary networks and w.r.t. simple schedule schemes. Online tuning of  hyperparameters is an important functionality and I hope your paper will make it more straightforward to use it in practice. 


* Minor notes:

You mention that "APO converges quickly from different starting points on the Rosenbrock surface" but 10000 iterations is not quick at all for the 2-dimensional Rosenbrock, it is extremely slow compared to 100-200 function evaluations needed for Nelder-Mead to solve it. I guess you mean w.r.t. the original RMSprop. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SklCKPP1h7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Simple and intuitive idea but needs more clarification</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJl6M2C5Y7&amp;noteId=SklCKPP1h7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1307 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">25 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1307 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper presents a method to update hyper-parameters (e.g. learning rate) before updating of model parameters. The idea is simple but intuitive. I am conservative about my rating now, I will consider raising it after the rebuttal.

1. The focus of this paper is the hyper-parameter, please focus and explain more on the usage with hyper-parameters. 
- no need to write so much in section 2.1, the surrogate is simple and common in optimization for parameters. After all, newton method and natural gradients method are not used in experiments.
- in section 2.2, please explain more how gradients w.r.t hyper-parameters are computed. 

2. No need to write so much decorated bounds in section 3. The convergence analysis is on Z, not on parameters x and hyper-parameters theta. So, bounds here can not be used to explain empirical observations in Section 5. 

3. Could authors explain the time complexity of inner loop in Algorithm 1? Does it take more time than that of updating model parameters?

4. Authors have done a good comparison in the context of deep nets.  However,
- could the authors compare with changing step-size? In most of experiments, the baseline methods, i.e. RMSProp are used with fixed rates. Is it better to decay learning rates for toy data sets? It is known that SGD with fixed step-size can not find the optimal for convex (perhaps, also simple) problems. 
- how to tune lambda? it is an important hyper-parameter, but it is set without a good principle, e.g., "For SGD-APO, we used lambda = 0.001, while for SGDm-APO, we used lambda = 0.01", "while for RMSprop-APO, the best lambda was 0.0001". What are reasons for these?
- In Section 5.2, it is said lambda is tuned by grid-search. Tuning a good lambda v.s. tuning a good step-size, which one costs more?
