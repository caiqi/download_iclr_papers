These methods typically work by generating node representations that are propagated throughout a given weighted graph.

Here we argue that for semi-supervised learning, it is more natural to consider propagating labels in the graph instead. Towards this end, we propose a differentiable neural version of the classic Label Propagation (LP) algorithm. This formulation can be used for learning edge weights, unlike other methods where weights are set heuristically. Starting from a layer implementing a single iteration of LP, we proceed by adding several important non-linear steps that significantly enhance the label-propagating mechanism.

Experiments in two distinct settings demonstrate the utility of our approach.

Here the authors will make prediction for absent labels based on local averages on the graph of the neighbouring soft labels. The main originality is that the local average is weighted and the weights are learnt. 

I had trouble understanding the details of the algorithm and the authors should be more careful in their description of the algorithm. Some points to clarify:
- section 3.1, I am not sure to understand the 'dynamic weights'. The main point here seems to be the use of an attention mechanism (which does not vary in time) applied to inputs varying in time?
- section 3.2, I do not understand equation (13). What is \theta^\tau, it does not appear in the right-hand term?

I think that using the term time is misleading. Time might refer to epochs in an optimization process, whereas time in Section 3 seems to refer to a number of layers as described in equation (6).

Please, be more explicit on the use of raw features. How are the similarities described in appendix B incorporated in the loss?

Overall, I think this paper requires a lot of clarification before being published.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJxISgAn2m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Method for non-linear label propagation while learning the network weights simultaneously.

There also needs to be a number of ablation studies to justify the effectiveness of the different components of this framework.  Finally, there seems to be an insufficient comparison (both experimentally and theoretically) to the large amount of related literature. 
- What is the total number of parameters in the proposed network? Please clarify how this is "relatively few parameters" as compared to other methods. 
- Please compare how your method for learning weights relates to the following papers and the references therein [1,2]
[1] Online Learning of Multiple Tasks and Their Relationships. Saha et al, AISTATS, 2011. 
[2] Convex Learning of Multiple Tasks and their Structure, Cilberto et al, 2015. 
- It would be good to have an ablation study in order to discern what is the contribution of learning the weights vs propagating labels (instead of embeddings). 
- For clarity, please specify that \theta are the parameters to be learned. 
- Please explain the intuition of using entropy and KL divergence for the attention weights. Shouldn't the attention for an edge be inversely proportional to the entropy i.e. the attention should be higher if the neighboring node's label is more certain?
- Instead of the bifurcation mechanism proposed in section 3.2, isn't it possible to use a threshold to round the resulting prediction to a hard label?
- In equation 13, are the hyper-parameters a, b tuned using cross-validation? Can't we learn the \tau in the same training procedure? Please justify this design decision?
- What is the performance if the loss in equation 14 is replaced by the standard empirical loss? There needs to be an ablation study on this. 
- If the node features are available, how are they used in this framework?
- In the experimental section, why is k chosen to be equal to 1%? Please show results while varying this. 
- Please justify the line "parameterizes w using a small number (~20) of informative features based on the raw features (e.g., dimensionality reduction), the graph (e.g., edge betweenness), and the labeled set (e.g., distance from labeled nodes). " Isn't it possible to get similar performance by reducing the number of parameters so that model doesn't overfit?
- Please clearly state what is the difference in the framework from the Kipf and Welling, 2016 paper?
- Why isn't there a comparison to methods like Graph-Sage?
- Please explain this line "LPNnobif degrades with large T, and even \tau slightly above 1 makes a difference"
- Finally, please explain the trend in the results in Table 1. For example, why is the performance of the proposed method poor on the Flickr dataset, but better on the DBLP dataset?

This paper proposes label propagation network (LPN), a neural network to learn label prediction and similarity measure (weights) between data points simultaneously in semi-supervised setting. The proposed method simulates label propagation steps with the forward pass of LPN, enabling backpropagation through label propagation steps.

Strong points
- Learning both weights and label predictions in SSL seems to be novel (provided that the author's claim in the related work section is right).
- Good performance.
- The paper is generally well written.

Concerns
- Replacing the label propagation by forward pass of a neural network is an attractive idea, but because of that the convergence guarantee is lost.  As Figure 4 shows, LPN without bifurcation mechanism seems to suffer from convergence issue as the number of evaluation step grows. I guess that the algorithm may go wrong even with bifurcation mechanism for some data, for example if the bifurcation rate grows too fast/slow.
- The original label propagation works with weights without entropy. Does introducing entropy term (e(h_i;theta)) is always helpful? For instance, if some data points erroneously get certain during initial iterations, the whole algorithm may fail.
- The performance reported for GCN is quite different from what is presented in the GCN paper, and authors explain that this is due to the different experimental setting. For me the performance gap is quite significant to be originated from different experimental setting. Could you elaborate on this? Also, how many GCN layers were used?
- Too many hyperparameters to tune.

Minor points
- I think the line above Eq (4) should be like \tilde w_ij = w_ij / sum_k w_ik.
- Eq (10) is quite misleading. The original weight w_ij should be symmetric (w_ij = w_ji), but this is not. Also, considering the intuition behind the label propagation, I think Eq (10) should be like alpha_ij(h_i, h_j) = exp(e(h_j) + d(h_i, h_j)), not e(h_i) as written the paper.
- In the experiments setting, the authors calling their algorithm as DeepLP_alpha and DeepLP_phi. I guess these should be LPN_alpha and LPN_phi.

I have three main issues/questions. 

First, it seems you are not using a standard split on Cora and Pubmed datasets - what is the reason? Could you please better explain in which settings your algorithm works well and in which it does not? (i.e. how sparse should the set of known nodes could be?) Using a common split makes it much easier to compare to other methods. 

Second, I am surprised you do not cite or compare to some "standard" graph CNN architectures (you can find a comprehensive review in [8]), such as spectral graph CNNs [1] (a seminal work of Bruna et al. that started the recent interest in this field), spectrum-free methods with polynomial [2] and rational [3] filters or their more recent variations with graph motifs [4]. Alongside with GAT and MoNet, you may want to look into architectures using graph shift operators[6], generalized attention mechanism on dual graphs [5], and dynamic graph update [7]. In particular, [5-6] are state-of-the-art on standard Cora split. 
    
Third, please note that [5] and [7] allow to learn the graph weights ([5] by performing convolutions on the dual graph, and [6] by updating the graph between layers). Also, in [9], in the context of geometric matrix completion, a learnable diffusion of score values (akin to "label propagation" in this context) was used. Perhaps you might want to rephrase some of the novelty statements in your introduction, or at least place them better in the context of prior works.

There are two questions I'd be interested to get your answer for:

(1) Why did you chose an experiment set-up for Cora/Citeseer/Pubmed that's different to the one of previous work? I understand that you rerun all the baselines. But it would still be helpful to have the results for the standard set-up for a more straight-forward comparison. 

(2) You might want to consider "Learning Graph Representations with Embedding Propagation" (EP; self plug) as related work. It is a NIPS'17 paper that describes how label/feature embeddings can be propagated throughout the graph. It is possible with EP to propagate and learn class label embeddings. Please don't get me wrong. Your method is in several ways novel (as far as I can tell) but since you did not cite EP as related work, I thought I make you aware of it.

1) Our experimental setting follows the classic graph-SSL evaluation scheme used in numerous works (*). The setting used in Yang et al. (2016) and in several other following papers is slightly different. The main difference lies in how data points are partitioned into train, validation, and test sets. In the classic setting, the labeled set is created by sampling k% of the data uniformly at random. The labeled set can then be used for training, validation, or any other usage deemed appropriate, and all other unlabeled points are used for evaluation. In contrast, Yang et al. (2016) uses three distinct sets: (a) a small, class-balanced train set, (b) a designated (and fairly large) validation set, and (c) a test set comprised of only a subset of the unlabeled points.

As recently pointed out in Oliver et al. (2018), SSL evaluation should be done with care. Based on the above (and other subtle differences), we believe the classic setting is better suited as an evaluation scheme for our paper.

2) Thank you for pointing out the EP paper. We will add it to the related work discussed in the paper. Our approach is different from EP, since our focus is on propagating class labels (as opposed to graph labels that are the focus of EP), and as such the aggregation and non-linearities we employ are tailored for points on the simplex, and our training loss is discriminative. It is quite likely however that the two methods can be combined.

I really like the EP-B paper and I would like to prefer it rather than GraphSAGE also published at NIPS 2017, because the EP-B paper has a very nice idea and a well-standard experimental setup for both the transductive and inductive settings that none of graph network-related ICLR submissions (that I have read) doing experiments on Cora/Citeseer/Pubmed cites the paper and follows the same setup. At this time, in my opinion, the *unsupervised* model EP-B is the best model obtaining state-of-the-art results in the transductive and inductive settings on the three datasets, even in comparison with semi-supervised models such as GAT and GCN.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
