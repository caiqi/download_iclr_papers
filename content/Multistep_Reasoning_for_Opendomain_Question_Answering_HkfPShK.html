The framework is agnostic to the architecture of the machine reading model and the retriever uses fast nearest neighbor search algorithms that allow it to scale to corpus containing millions of paragraphs. We show the efficacy of our architecture by achieving state-of-the-art results on large open domain datasets such as TriviaQA-unfiltered \citep{joshi2017triviaqa}. We also show that our multi-step-reasoning framework brings uniform improvements when applied to two different reader architectures. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Open domain Question Answering, Reinforcement Learning, Query reformulation</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Paragraph retriever and machine reader interacts with each other via reinforcement learning to yield large improvements on open domain datasets</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1lQ7Ar52X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting and encouraging results but limited novelties</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkfPSh05K7&amp;noteId=H1lQ7Ar52X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1551 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1551 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper proposes a multi-document extractive machine reading model and algorithm. The model is composed of 3 distinct parts. First, the document retriever and the document reader that are states of the art modules. Then, the paper proposes to use a "multi-step-reasoner" which learns to reformulate the question into its latent space wrt its current value and the "state" of the machine reader.

In the general sense, the architecture can be seen as a specific case of a memory network. Indeed, the multi-reasoner step can be seen as the controller update step of a memory network type of inference. The retriever is the attention module and the reader as the final step between the controller state and the answer prediction.

The authors claim the method is generic, however, the footnote in section 2.3 mentioned explicitly that the so-called state of the reader assumes the presence of a multi-rnn passage encoding. Furthermore, this section 2.3 gives very little detailed about the "reinforcement learning" algorithms used to train the reasoning module.

Finally, the experimental section, while giving encouraging results on several datasets could also have been used on QAngoroo dataset to assess the multi-hop capabilities of the approach. Furthermore, very little details are provided regarding the reformulation mechanism and its possible interpretability.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BylrP5Q92m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Very interesting idea; needs more details and better evaluation</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkfPSh05K7&amp;noteId=BylrP5Q92m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1551 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1551 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors improve a retriever-reader architecture for open-domain QA by iteratively retrieving passages and tuning the retriever with reinforcement learning. They first learn vector representations of both the question and context, and then iteratively change the vector representation of the question to improve results. I think this is a very interesting idea and the paper is generally well written.

I find some of the description of the models, methods and training is lacking detail. For example, their should be more detail on how REINFORCE was implemented; e.g. was a baseline used?

I am not sure about the claim that their method is agnostic to the choice of machine reader, given that the model needs access to internal states of the reader and their limited results on BiDAF.

The presentation of the results left a few open questions for me:

  - It is not clear to me which retrieval method was used for each of the baselines in Table 2.
  - Why does Table 2 not contain the numbers obtained by the DrQA model (both using the retrieval method from the DrQA method and their method without reinforcement learning)? That would make their improvements clear.
  - Moreover, for TriviaQA their results and the cited baselines seem to all perform well below to current top models for the task (cf. <a href="https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17208#results)." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17208#results).</a>
  - I would also like to see a better analysis of how the number of steps helped increase F1 for different models and datasets. The presentation should include a table with number of steps and F1 for different step numbers they tried. (Figure 2 is lacking here.)
  - In the text, the authors claim that their result shows that natural language is inferior to 'rich embedding spaces'. They base this on a comparison with the AQA model. There are two problems with this claim: 1) The two approaches 'reformulate' for different purposes, retrieval and machine reading, so they are not directly comparable. 2) Both approaches use a 'black box' machine reading model, but the authors use DrQA as the base model while AQA uses BiDAF. Indeed, since the authors have an implementation of their model that uses BiDAF, an additional comparison based on matched machine reading models would be interesting.
- Generally, it would be great to see more detailed results for their BiDAF-based model as well.

While retriever-reader framework was often used for open-domain QA, this bi-directional interaction between the retriever and the reader is novel and effective because
1) If the retriever fails to retrieve the right document at the first step, the reader can give a signal to the retriever so that the retriever can recover its mistake at the next step
2) The idea of `reader state` from the reader to the retriever is new
3) The retriever use question-independent representation of paragraphs, which does not require different representation depending on the question and makes the framework easily scalable.

Strengths
1) The idea of multi-step &amp; bi-directional interaction between the retriever and the reader is novel enough (as mentioned above). The paper contains enough literature studies on existing retriever-reader framework in open-domain setting, and clearly demonstrates how their framework is different from them.
2) The authors run the experiments on 4 different dataset, which supports the argument about the frameworkâ€™s effectiveness.

Weakness
1) The authors seem to highlight multi-step `reasoning`, while it is not `reasoning` in my opinion. Multi-step reasoning refers to the task which you need evidence from different documents, and/or you need to find first evident to find the second evidence from a different document. I donâ€™t think the dataset here are not multi-step reasoning dataset, and the authors seem not to claim it either. Therefore, I recommend using another term (maybe `multi-step interaction`?) instead of `multi-step reasoning`.
2) While the idea of multi-step interaction and how it benefits the overall performance is interesting, the analysis is not enough. Figure 3 in the paper does not have enough description â€” for example, I got the left example means step 2 recovers the mistake from step 1, but what does the right example mean?

Questions on result comparison
1) On TriviaQA (both open and full), the authors mentioned the result is on hidden test set â€” did you submit it to the leaderboard? I donâ€™t see the same numbers on the TriviaQA leaderboard. Also, the authors claim they are SOTA on TriviaQA, but there are higher numbers on the leaderboard (which are submitted prior to the ICLR deadline).
2) There are other published papers with higher result on Quasar-T, SearchQA and TriviaQA (such as <a href="https://aclanthology.info/papers/P18-1161/p18-1161" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://aclanthology.info/papers/P18-1161/p18-1161</a> and https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08092) which the authors did not compare with.
3) In Section 4.2, is there a reason for the specific comparison to AQA (5th line), though AQA is not SOTA on SearchQA? I donâ€™t think it means latent space is better than natural language space. They are totally different model and the only intersection is they contains interaction between two submodules.
4) In Section 5, the authors mentioned their framework outperforms previous SOTA by 15% margin on TriviaQA, but what is that? I donâ€™t see 15% margin in Table 2.

Marginal comments:
1) If I understood correctly, `TriviaQA-open` and `TriviaQA-full` in the paper are officially called `TriviaQA-full` and `open-domain TriviaQA`. How about changing the term for readers to better understand the task? Also, in Section 4, the authors said TriviaQA-open is larger than web/wiki setting, but to my knowledge, this setting is part of the wiki setting.
2) It would be great if the authors make the capitalization consistent. e.g. EM, Quasar-T, BiDAF. Also, the authors can use EM instead of `exact match` after they mentioned EM refers to exact match in Section 4.2.

Overall comment
The idea in the paper is interesting, and their model and experiments are concrete. My only worries is that the terms in the paper are confusing and performance comparison are weak. I would like to update the score when the authors update the paper.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
