For instance, dropout has been known to improve performance by reducing co-adaptation, and representational sparsity has been argued as a good characteristic because many data-generation processes have only a small number of factors that are independent. In this work, we analytically and empirically investigate the popular characteristics of learned representations, including correlation, sparsity, dead unit, rank, and mutual information, and disprove many of the \textit{conventional wisdom}. We first show that infinitely many Identical Output Networks (IONs) can be constructed for any deep network with a linear layer, where any invertible affine transformation can be applied to alter the layer's representation characteristics. The existence of ION proves that the correlation characteristics of representation can be either low or high for a well-performing network. Extensions to ReLU layers are provided, too. Then, we consider sparsity, dead unit, and rank to show that only loose relationships exist among the three characteristics. It is shown that a higher sparsity or additional dead units do not imply a better or worse performance when the rank of representation is fixed. We also develop a rank regularizer and show that neither representation sparsity nor lower rank is helpful for improving performance even when the data-generation process has only a small number of independent factors. Mutual information $I(\z_l;\x)$ and $I(\z_l;\y)$ are investigated as well, and we show that regularizers can affect $I(\z_l;\x)$ and thus indirectly influence the performance. Finally, we explain how a rich set of regularizers can be used as a powerful tool for performance tuning. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">learned representation, statistical characteristics, information theoretical characteristics, deep network</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Bygh4ga53m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A preliminary effort to investigate the significance of statistical characteristics of DNN representations</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryeyti0qKX&amp;noteId=Bygh4ga53m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper406 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper406 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper makes concerted efforts to examine the existing beliefs about the significance of various statistical characteristics of hidden layer activations (or representations) in a DNN. In the past, many works have argued for encouraging the certain statistical behavior of these representations (e.g., sparsity, low correlation etc) in order to have better classification accuracy. However, this paper tries to argue that such efforts are not very useful as these statistical characteristics don't provide any systematic explanation for the performance of DNNs across different settings. 

First, the paper argues that given a DNN, it's possible to construct either an identical output network or a comparable network that can have very different behavior for some of the statistical characteristics. This casts doubt on the usefulness of these characteristics in explaining the performance of the network. The paper conducts experiments with different regularizers associated with some of the standard statistical characteristics using the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets. The paper claims that for each dataset the best performing network cannot be attributed to any single regularizer. For the same set of regularizers and the MNIST dataset, the paper then explores the mutual information between the inputs and the hidden layer activations. The paper observes that the best performing regularizer is the one which minimizes this mutual information. Therefore, it is plausible that the mutual information regularization can consistently explain the performance of an NN.

The paper addresses an interesting problem and makes some good contributions. However, the reviewer feels that the brief treatment of mutual information regularizer leaves something to be desired. Did the authors also examine the relationship between mutual information and generalization error for CIFAR data sets? Does it not make sense to examine this for all (most of) the setups considered in Table 4, 8, and 9.  

In these tables, how do the authors decide which hidden layer representations should be explored for their statistical characteristics?

The reviewer feels that for CIFAR-10 and 100, some regularizers do consistently give best or close to best networks. Could the authors comment on this?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJeleGmwnQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>important topic but weak results</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryeyti0qKX&amp;noteId=HJeleGmwnQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper406 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">31 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper406 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper studies the characteristics of representations and their roles in neural network expressiveness. The results  are overall not very impressive. 

1. There are many characteristics of representations such as scaling, permutation, covariance, correlation, sparsity, dead units, rank. The papers discusses some (not surprising) theoretical properties relating to scaling, permutation, covariance, correlation, while making less efforts on the more interesting characteristics  sparsity, dead units, rank, mutual information. Only some heuristic results are obtained for them without rigorous theory. It would be better if these heuristic arguments can be formed as theorems as well.

2. Probably the most interesting experimental finding of this paper is that the mutual information between z and output is constant, while the one between z and input strongly depends on the regularizers. That is, the dependence between z and y does not vary with regularizers but the one between z and x does. Is this a coincidence or a general phenomenon? Is there a theoretical explanation?

The claim is that most of these tools do not help improve performance, with the exception of mutual information.

Pros: It's interesting to investigate and compare these different "regularization" techniques and compare them on different tasks empirically.

Cons:
Many of the points made in the paper are not properly capturing the nuance in the "conventional wisdom", and although it's good to be reminded and the empirical results are interesting to look at, in fact these are not really new discoveries, and sometimes the conclusions are very misleading. 

1) There is test loss, and there is generalization loss, and it isn't exactly the same thing. For a hypothesis class H, we have

test loss &lt;= train loss + generalization loss 

where train loss measures how well we've fit a particular sample, and generalization loss measures how well a model that is trained on one sample can fit a new sample. Note that if I apply L2 loss to my model and have a regularization parameter --&gt; infty, my train loss is huge but my generalization loss is 0. In other words, for a large enough regularization parameter, most of the methods experimented here WILL limit effective capacity and minimize generalization loss; it just will not give you the best test error performance. So the distinction here should be made much clearer--conventional wisdom for regularization limiting generalization error is not wrong.

2) The point that is trying to be made in section 3.1 is somewhat well-known in the general optimization literature. Let's consider a much simpler example: linear regression 

min_x ||Ax-b||_2^2 + gamma ||x||_2^2

Let's consider first no regularization, gamma = 0. Assume that A has a huge nullspace. Then technically there are an infinite number of globally optimal solutions x, although if we solve this problem using SGD starting with x = 0, it is known that the minimum norm solution is always picked. You can also think of this as whitening, since large lambda smooths the spectrum of the Hessian. Now add in regularization. Now the solution is unique, even if A is ill-conditioned. It's true that it isn't super necessary to add this regularization, since SGD can get you a good solution, but now we can GUARANTEE that the generalization error is 0. In practice, also, regularization adds stability to the numerics. 

In deep learning, the hidden layer z also acts as a coefficient matrix for determining y. I assume that is why people pursue low correlation, since it affects the conditioning of z. 

3) Comments like  "for scaling and permutation, their influences are rather insignificant" seem a bit careless to me. In fact it is well known that scaling can affect training performance significantly. But of course, if I know the global solution for z which feeds into a softmax, then any scaling on z does not affect the output of the softmax. That, however, does not mean I don't care about the scaling of z when training. 

4) Sparsity and rank BOTH limit the degrees of freedom. In fact, sparsity makes more sense when optimizing a nonlinear objective, which is always the case in deep learning. The reason to limit rank is when you wish to "learn your codewords", e.g. the eigenvectors, whereas in sparsity, the "codewords" are already learned, and you just learn the weighting. But if the codewords span the space, they both have equal representability. 

4) It is not clear to me what the task is in 4.3. What is the "accuracy" in a data generation task? Is this the normal classification task? If so, is the accuracy reported train or test accuracy? How exactly is generalization error being measured? 


5)I am not clear as to what conclusion is being drawn in section 5, with the last sentence "obviously, many of the statistical characteristics become meaningless for such a scalar representation, and it is high time to reconsider the so-called conventional wisdom on representation characteristics." why is this conclusion drawn based on the observation that, if a scalar z perfectly correlates with y, in fact this is the most generalization neural network? 

6) Table 4: how did you choose your hyperparameters? (regularization performance is extremely sensitive to parameter choice.)

7) A major concern is that basically very little training is done in these comparisons, except in the very last section. As I previously mentioned, many of these regularization / normalization techniques are also meant to better condition the optimization itself, and thus this advantage should not be discarded. 


minor comments:
 - page 5 last sentence "characteristics" should be singular
 - page 8 first sentence "to [a] deep network's performance"</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: Clear rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
