However, recent studies show that these approaches severely suffers from the issue of biased prediction under the more realistic generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) scenarios, i.e., their classifier tends to predict all the examples from both seen and unseen class as one of the seen classes. The cause of this problem is that we can not obtain training data of the unseen class and that the representation of attributes is poor. To solve this, we propose a concept to learn a mapping that embeds both images and attributes to a space that is robust to such representations and generalized even for unseen data, which we refer to shared manifold learning. Furthermore, we propose modality invariant variational autoencoders, which can perform shared manifold learning by training variational autoencoders with both images and attributes as inputs. The empirical validation of well-known datasets in GZSL shows that our method achieves the significantly superior performances to the existing relation-based works.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">zero-shot learning, variational autoencoders</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SklW-AE5nQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>application of multimodal VAE for zero shot learning</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkesr205t7&amp;noteId=SklW-AE5nQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1576 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1576 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes a multimodal VAE model for the problem of generalized zero shot learning (GZSL). In GZSL, the test classes can contain examples from both seen as well as unseen classes, and due to the bias of the model towards the seen classes, the standard GZSL approaches tend to predict the majority of the inputs to belong to seen classes. The paper proposes a multimodal VAE model to mitigate this issue where a shared manifold learning learn for the inputs and the class attribute vectors.

The problem of GZSL is indeed important. However, the idea of using multimodal VAE for ZSL isn't new or surprising and has been used in earlier papers too. In fact, multimodal VAEs are natural to apply for such problems. The proposed multimodal VAE model is very similar to the existing ones, such as Vedantam et al (2017), who proposed a broad framework with various types of regularizers in the multimodal VAE framework. Therefore, the methodological novelty of the work is somewhat limited.

The other key issue is that the experimental results are quite underwhelming. The paper doesn't compare with several recent ZSL and GZSL approaches, some of which have reported accuracies that look much better than the accuracies achieved by the proposed method. The paper does cite some of these papers (such as those based on synthesized examples) but doesn't provide any comparison. Given that the technical novelty is somewhat limited, the paper falls short significantly on the experimental analysis.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1xKsv3F2Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting and novel extension of joint-VAEs in zero-shot learning.

To learn such a shared latent space and mapping for the same which is generalized and robust -- the authors propose ‘modality invariant variational autoencoders’ -- which allows one to perform shared manifold learning by training VAEs with both images and attributes as inputs. Empirical results demonstrate improvements over existing approaches on the harmonic mean metric present in the generalized zero-shot learning benchmark. Other than the concerns mentioned below, I like the basic idea adopted in the paper to extend Vedantam et. al. (2018)’s joint-VAEs (supporting unimodal inference) to the framework of generalized zero-shot learning. The proposed approach clearly results in improvements over baselines and existing approaches.

Comments:
- A minor correction. The paper claims the bias towards seen classes at inference for the existing GZSL approaches is due to the inability of obtaining training data for the unseen classes. In my opinion, this should be rephrased as the inability to learn a generalized enough representation (joint or otherwise) that is aware of the shift in distribution from seen to unseen classes (images or attributes) as this information is not available apriori.
- Writing Clarity Issues. In general, there is significant repetitions along certain lines throughout the introduction and approach. While the paper overall does a good job of explaining the motivation as well as the approach, some of the sections (and sentences within) could be written better to express the point being made. Specifically, the first paragraph in the introduction seems to be structured more from a few-shot setting. The paper would benefit from talking about few-shot learning first and then extending to the extreme setting of zero-shot learning. Similarly, the second paragraph in the introduction could be written more succinctly to express the point being made. The sentences -- “Moreover, it is difficult….widely available” -- are difficult to understand. Tables 4 and 5 should be positioned after the references section.
- A point repeatedly made in the paper suggests that learning unidirectional mappings from images to attributes (or otherwise) suffers from generalization to unseen classes. While I agree with this statement, most methods in GZSL hold out a subset of seen classes as validation (unseen) classes while learning such a mapping -- which I believe was also being done while learning the joint model in MIVAE (Can the authors confirm this? Is yes, how were these classes chosen?). As such, the authors should stress on the advantages learning a joint latent model over both modalities offers as opposed to unidirectional mappings while mentioning the above points.
- Learning the joint latent space for images and attributes has been referred to as learning a shared manifold in the paper -- with associated terms such as manifold representation being used as well. Sharing a latent space need not imply learning an entire manifold as the subspace captured by the latent space might as well be localized in the manifold in which it exists. Can the authors comment more on this connection with respect to the points around “shared manifold learning”?
- During inference, the authors operate in the latent space to find the most-relevant class by enumerating over all classes the KL-divergence between the unimodal encoder embeddings. Is there a particular reason the authors chose to operate in the latent space as opposed to operating in a modality space? Specifically, given an image the authors could have used the p(a|z) decoder to infer the attribute given the encoded z -- and subsequently finding the 1-nearest neighbor in that space. Any reason why this approach was not adopted? 
- On page 4, regarding the term L_dist in the objective for MIVAE, the authors draw the connections made in the appendix of Vedantam et. al. (2018) regarding the minimization of KL-divergence between the bimodal and a unimodal variational posterior(s). While the connection being made is accurate, the subsequent solution modes identified in the following paragraph -- “When equation 2 becomes minimum…” -- do not seem accurate. At minimality, unimodal encoders should be equivalent to the bimodal encoder marginalized over the absent rv under the conditional distribution of the data. Could the authors comment on whether the version presented in the paper is intended or is merely a typographical mistake?
Section 5 experiments suggest the learning rate used in practice was 10^3. Assuming a typo, this should be presumably 10^-3.

Experimental Issues. 
- The authors should explicitly mention if they are using the proposed split throughout all baselines and approaches for GZSL evaluations. It’s not explicitly mentioned in the text and is an important detail that should not be left out. Only the appendix mentions the number of seen/unseen classes.
- How did the authors select a validation split (held out seen classes) to train MIVAE? Did they directly borrow the training and validation splits present in the proposed split? Or did they create a split of their own? If latter, how was the split created? In general, I am curious about how the MIVAE checkpoint for inference was chosen.
- In section 5.2, the reasons in the 3rd paragraph elaborating \lambda_map=1 vs 0 not being too different for AWA and aPY are not clear. Could the authors comment a bit more on them?

Most zero-shot learning methods embed images and text/attribute representations into a common space. The main difference here seems to be that Variational AutoEncoder (VAEs) are used to learn the mappings that take different sources as input (images and attributes). 
As in JMVAE (Suzuki et al., 2016) (which was not proposed for zero-shot learning), decoders are then used to reconstruct objects from the latent space to the input sources.

My main concerns are about novelty. The contribution of the paper is limited or not clear at all, even when reading Section C in the appendix. The proposed approach is a straightforward extension of JMVAE (Suzuki et al., 2016) where a loss function is added (Eq. (3)) to minimize the KL divergence between the outputs of the encoders (which corresponds to optimizing the same problem as most zero-shot learning approaches).
The theoretical aspect of the method is then limited since the proposed loss function actually corresponds to optimize the same problem as most zero-shot learning approaches but with VAEs.

Concerning experiments, Generalized Zero shot learning (GZSL) experiments seem to significantly outperform other methods, whereas results on the standard zero-shot learning task perform as well as state-of-the-art methods. 
Do the authors have an explanation of why the approach performs significantly better only on the GZSL task?

In conclusion, the contributions of the paper are mostly experimental. Most arguments in the model section are actually simply intuitions.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
