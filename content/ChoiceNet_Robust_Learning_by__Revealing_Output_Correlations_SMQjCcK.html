We assume that the training dataset is generated from a mixture of a target distribution and other unknown distributions. We estimate the quality of each data by revealing the correlation between the generated distribution and the target distribution. To this end, we present a novel framework referred to here as ChoiceNet that can robustly infer the target distribution in the presence of inconsistent data. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is applicable to both classification and regression tasks. Particularly, ChoiceNet is evaluated in comprehensive experiments, where we show that it constantly outperforms existing baseline methods in the handling of noisy data in synthetic regression tasks as well as behavior cloning problems. In the classification tasks, we apply the proposed method to the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and it shows superior performances in terms of robustness to different types of noisy labels.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Robust Deep Learning, weakly supervised learning</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1eAxJHGa7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting Approach with Insufficient Results</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1MQ6jCcK7&amp;noteId=B1eAxJHGa7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper789 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">09 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper789 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper presents an apparently original method targeted toward models training in the presence of low-quality or corrupted data. To accomplish this they introduce a "mixture of correlated density network" (MCDN), which processes representations from a backbone network, and the MCDN models the corrupted data generating process. Evaluation is on a regression problem with an analytic function, two MuJoCo problems, MNIST, and CIFAR-10.

This paper's primary strength is that the proposed method is a tool quite distinct from recent work, in that it does not use bootstrapping or solely use corruption transition matrices. The paper is typeset well. In addition to this, the experimentation has unusual breadth.

However, the synthetic regression task is a nice proof-of-concept, but thorough regression evaluation could perhaps include the Boston Housing Prices dataset or some UCI datasets.

The hamartia of this paper is that it does not provide sufficient depth in its computer vision experiments. For one, experimentation on CIFAR-100 would be appreciated.
In the CIFAR-10 experiments, they consider one label corruption setting and lack experimentation on uniform label corruptions.
The related works has thorough coverage on label corruption, but these works do not appear in the experiments. They instead compare their label corruption technique to mixup, a general-purpose network regularizer. It is not clear why it is thought the "state-of-the-art technique on noisy labels"; this may be true among network regularization approaches (such as dropout) but not among label correction techniques. For this problem I would expect comparison to at least three label correction techniques, but the comparison is to one technique which was not primarily designed for label corruption.


Nitpicks:
-In the related works we are told that a smaller learning rate can improve label corruption robustness. They train their method with a learning rate of 0.001; the baseline gets a learning rate of 0.1.
-The larger-than-usual batch size is 256 for their 22-4 Wide ResNets, and at the same time they do not use dropout (standard for WRNs of this width) and use less weight decay than is common. Is this because of mixup? If so why is the weight decay two orders of magnitude less for your approach compared to the baseline? How were these various atypical parameters chosen?
-They also use gradient clipping for their method, which is extremely rare for CIFAR-10 classification. Why is this necessary?
-This document could be cleaner by eschewing the Theorem of this paper, which "states that a correlation between two random matrices is invariant to an affine transform." For this audience, I suspect this theorem is unnecessary. Likewise the three lines expended for the maths of a Gaussian probability density function could probably be used for other parts of this paper.

supervision outputs (e.g., labels) are corrupted by noise. The method relies on 
estimating the correlation between the training data distribution and a 
target distribution, where training data distribution is assumed to be a mixture 
of that target distribution and other unknown distributions. The paper also 
presents some compelling results on synthetic and real datasets, for both 
regression and classification problems.

The proposed idea builds on top of previously published work on Mixture Density 
Networks (MDNs) and Mixup (Zhang et al, 2017). The main difference is the MDN 
are modified to construct the Mixture of Correlated Density Network (MCDN) 
block, that forms the main component of ChoiceNets.

I like the overall direction and idea of modelling correlation between the 
target distribution and the data distribution to deal with noisy labels. The 
results are also compelling and I thus lean towards accepting this paper. My 
decision on "marginal accept" is based primarily on my unfamiliarity with this 
specific area and that some parts of the paper are not very easy or intuitive 
to read through.

== Related Work ==

I like the related work discussion, but would emphasize more the connection to 
MDNs and to Mixup. Only one sentence is mentioned about Mixup but reading 
through the abstract and the introduction that is the first paper that came to 
my mind and thus I believe that it may deserve a bit more discussion.

Also, there are a couple more papers that felt relevant to this work but are 
not mentioned:
  - Estimating Accuracy from Unlabeled Data: A Bayesian Approach, Platanios et al., ICML 2016.
    I believe this is related in how noisy labels are modeled (i.e., section 3 
    in the reviewed paper) and in the idea of correlation/consistency as a means 
    to detect errors. There are couple more papers in this line of work that 
    may be relevant.
  - ADIOS: Architectures Deep In Output Space, Al-Shedivat et al., ICML 2016.
    I believe this is related in learning some structure in the output space, 
    even though not directly dealing with noisy labels.

== Method ==

I believe the methods section could have been written in a more 
clear/easy-to-follow way, but this may also be due to my unfamiliarity with this 
area. Figure 1 is hard to parse and does not really offer much more than section 
3.2 currently does. If the figure is improved with some more text/labels on 
boxes rather than plain equations, it may go a long way in making the methods 
section easier to follow.

I would also point out MCDN as the key contribution of this paper as ChoiceNet 
is just any base network with an MCDN block stacked on top of this. Thus, I 
believe this should be emphasized more to make your key contribution clear.

== Experiments ==

The experiments are nicely presented and are quite thorough. A couple minor 
comments I have are:

  - It would be nice to run regression experiments for bigger real-world 
    datasets, as the ones used seem to be quite small.
  - I am a bit confused at the fact that in table 3 you compare your method to 
    mixup and in table 4 you also show results when using both your method and 
    mixup combined. Up until that point I thought that mixup was posed as an 
    alternative method, but here it seems it's quite orthogonal and can be used 
    together, which I think makes sense, but would be good to clarify. Also, 
    given that you show combined results in table 4, why not also perform 
    exactly the same analysis for table 3 and also show numbers for CN + Mixup?

It would also be nice to use the same naming scheme for both tables. I would 
use: ConvNet, ConvNet + CN, ConvNet + CN + Mixup, and the same with WRN for 
table 4. This would make the tables easier to read because currently the first 
thing that comes to mind is what may be different between the two setups given 
that they are presented side-by-side but use different naming conventions.

One question that comes to mind is that you make certain assumptions on the 
kinds of noise your model can capture, so are there any cases where you have 
good intuition as to why your model may fail? It would be good to present a 
short discussion on this to help readers understand whether they can benefit by 
using your model or not.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SyxB2-Bd3m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>ok papers but lacking of related works, important baselines and well-motivated storyline.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1MQ6jCcK7&amp;noteId=SyxB2-Bd3m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper789 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper789 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper formulates a new deep learning method called ChoiceNet for noisy data. Their main idea is to estimate the densities of data distributions using a set of correlated mean functions. They argue that ChoiceNet can robustly infer the target distribution on corrupted data.

Pros:

1. The authors find a new angle for learning with noisy labels. For example, the keypoint of ChoiceNet is to design the mixture of correlated density network block. 

2. The authors perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their framework in both regression tasks and classification tasks. And their experimental result support their previous claims.

Cons:

We have three questions in the following.

1. Related works: In deep learning with noisy labels, there are three main directions, including small-loss trick [1-3], estimating noise transition matrix [4-6], and explicit and implicit regularization [7-9]. I would appreciate if the authors can survey and compare more baselines in their paper instead of listing some basic ones.

2. Experiment: 
2.1 Baselines: For noisy labels, the authors should add MentorNet [1] as a baseline <a href="https://github.com/google/mentornet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/google/mentornet</a> From my own experience, this baseline is very strong. At the same time, they should compare with VAT [7]. 

2.2 Datasets: For datasets, I think the author should first compare their methods on symmetric and aysmmetric noisy data [4]. Besides, the current paper only verifies on vision datasets. The authors are encouraged to conduct 1 NLP dataset.

3. Motivation: The authors are encouraged to re-write their paper with more motivated storyline. The current version is okay but not very exciting for idea selling.
