This is done by learning an extension function g(z) from R^d to R^{D-d} and then using the change of variables formula on x and [z, g(z)]. To model probabilistically the deterministic function g(z) is replaced by Normal distribution with mean g(z) and a small variance.

PIE is used to build deep generative models and trained on the MNIST dataset. The authors show that the models learnt via PIE produce sharper samples than VAEs and Wasserstein autoencoders (WAEs). No comparison to real NVP is made, which should be the main baseline of comparison to answer the question of "what is the advantage of having d &lt; D?". Further MNIST is no longer a good enough benchmark to evaluate deep generative models. Most representative work in this literature use CIFAR-10, downsampled Imagenet, or Imagenet at 256x256.

This work falls short of the standards of ICLR in a few ways:

1. The presentation is unclear. The explanation of the extension-restriction idea is overly complicated. Further, the paper does very little to properly contextualize this work in the literature. Real NVP and flow-based models are mentioned but the proposed technique is not compared to it. The authors say they "introduce new class of likelihood-based Auto-Encoders", but this is false as far as I understood. The technique is not even an autoencoder since a separate decoder is not trained, and is obtained by exactly inverting the encoder as in real NVP.

2. The experiments are weak. The samples shown are of poor quality, and on a very simplisitic dataset (MNIST). The authors compare with vanilla VAEs, but ignore more recent improvements to VAE such as VAE-IAF, flow-based models, and also autoregressive models. A heuristic is used to measure sharpness and only used to compare against VAE and WAE. Since all these models allow likelihood evaluation, likelihoods should also have been compared.

3. The technique itself is a small change over real NVP and it's not clear whether this change brings any improvements or provides any insights about generative modeling.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: Clear rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJxyHtAn37" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An interesting model without thorough evaluations  </a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgiX2Aqtm&amp;noteId=rJxyHtAn37"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1388 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1388 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">In this paper, an invertible encoding method is proposed for learning latent representations and deep generators via inverting the encoder. The proposed method can be seen as an autoencoder without the need to learn the decoder. This can be computed by inverting the encoder. To the best of my knowledge the proposed method is novel and its building blocks are described adequately. 

My main questions are the following: What is the main advantage of this model? Does it make the problem of deep generative model learning tractable? If so, under what conditions?

Discussion of prior art and relevant methods is limited in the paper and it can be extended. The authors may want to consider discussing relevant work on invertible autoencoders (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06869.pdf)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06869.pdf)</a> and methods like https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryj38zWRb which can be seen as symmetric to the proposed one in the sense that an encoderless autoencoder is learnt. 

The experimental evaluation is limited. The authors should consider to compare their method with other relevant models such as those mentioned above as well as GANs and their variants. Experiments on other more complex real-world data (e.g., faces) are also needed in order to prove the merits of the proposed model.

In general, this is a well-written paper and I feel pleasant to read the paper. The paper proposed a model named Pseudo Invertible Autoencoder(PIE) which combines invertible architecture and inference model.

Strength:
1. The explanation of the paper is very clear and consistent.
2. The idea is interesting. A lot of papers related to the inverse problem focus on perfect invertibility, but the author(s) emphasize the importance of invertible compression and relate PIE to the inference model.

Possible Improvements:
1. The experiments could have been more convincing: 1) The only competitors are VAE and WAE. 2)The only data set has been tested was MNIST data set. There are many great works mentioned in the paper and those works should also be compared in a way.
2. The content could be more compact so that more experiments can be shown to support the paper. It seems to me there is too much explanation to previous works in the paper. 
3. The paper has 9 pages which exceed the suggestion a little bit.
4. I am not sure if the author(s) checked the grammar of the paper carefully. I found quite few typos in the paper. Page 3: 'Rather then' should be 'Rather than' and 'As we are interested' should be as 'As we are interested in'; Page 4: 'Can me' should be 'Can be'; Page 6: 'Better then' should be 'Better than'; Fig.6 (b): Should it be '0' or 'g(z)'?

Conclusion:
This is a good and clean paper in general. It explains the related work and presents PIE with necessary details. My biggest concern is that empirical validation(experiment) is poor. As a conclusion, I tend to vote for weak rejection.

Minor Suggestion:
Refer to the conference instead of arXiv if the paper was already published.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1xo1vQAqX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Understanding Questions and related work</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgiX2Aqtm&amp;noteId=S1xo1vQAqX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures"><a href="/profile?id=~Robin_Tibor_Schirrmeister1" class="profile-link">Robin Tibor Schirrmeister</a></span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">12 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1388 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Hi, quite interesting paper!
First, I have some questions for understanding it correctly.

1) In figure 3 c), what is the meaning of the green lines? From the text, I assumed g_k(z_k) should only be computed from those dimensions that will be processed further, correct? So in the case of the second layer, g_k(z_k) only from those 4 dimensions that will be processed further? So why are there green lines from all eight nodes of the second layer to the one node at the bottom? And what should this one node symbolize? r_k? Comparison between r_k and g_k(z_k)?

2) What exactly is used in the generation of data/in the inversion for the values of the r's? In Figure 6 b) it looks as if you put in 0s? Shouldn't you put in g(z)? Or even sample from the gaussian with standard deviation eps_0 centered at g(z)?

Also wanted to mention two possibly related works for your consideration: In our paper "Training Generative Reversible Networks" <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01610" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01610</a> , we also use a reduced latent dimensionality, however without a rigorous mathematical motivation. In the parallel ICLR submission "Analyzing Inverse Problems with Invertible Neural Network" (https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJed6j0cKX) the authors  experiment with a different kind of partitioning of the latent space.

1) In Fig. 3 the green lines indicate the aggregation of the variables in objective function. 
For examples, the blue nodes of the 2nd layer which are discarded (r_k) 
and the variables which will be further processed (z_k) are aggregated in a conditional distribution
p(r_k| z_k) = \delta(r_k - g_k(z_k)). 
We will try to change the scheme in order to avoid confusion.

2.1) Why 0?
In experiments with Gaussian PIE we used g(z) = 0. 
Therefore, x = [z, 0] as it is indicated in Eq. 20. 
We will change Fig. 6 (b) in order to exactly match Eq. 20.

2.2) To sample or not to sample?
In our experiment we demonstrate the behaviour of function G, defined in Eq. 4.
The operation of extension of the function is deterministic. 

We conducted the experiments, where we used sampling from N(g(z), eps^2 I). 
The obtained images were visually close to those depicted in the current version of the paper.

3) Thank you for providing us with interesting and useful papers. 
We will consider them during the next revision of the paper.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
