Our algorithm draws ideas from (1) isotonic regression for learning neural networks and (2) landscape analysis of non-convex matrix factorization problems.

The main result is a learning algorithm and provable guarantees using the algorithm.  This result extends previous analysis to handle the learning of the output layer weights, and holds for symmetric input distributions with identity covariance matrix.

At a high level, the proof works by using the non-overlapping part of the filter to reduce the problem to matrix factorization. 
The reduced problem corresponds to learning a rank-one matrix, from which one can learn the output layer weight vector approximately. Given the output weight vector, then the hidden layer weight is learnt using the Convotron algorithm from previous analysis. I think that the technical contribution is interesting.

Weakness: Given the existing work (Goel et al. 2018), I am concerned that the current work is a bit incremental. Secondly, it is unclear if the technical insight has any applications or not. How does the proposed algorithm work on real world data? Even some simple comparisons to other algorithms on a few datasets would provide insight.

Question: Where does Assumption 3.2 arise in the proof? Is it necessary (for the proof)?

Other issues: A few typos you may need to fix (e.g. the S notation in Thm 3.1, first sentence in Sec 4.3).

First, we want to emphasize that the generalization of Convotron [1] to handle approximately known weights in the second layer is highly non-trivial. It requires an analysis of the new patch matrix that is weighted by the coefficients. We use a substantially different technique from [1] to show the given property. In particular, we use properties of Toeplitz matrices which might be of independent interest.

Second, we believe our theoretically inspired layer by layer training procedure can be heuristically extended for deeper layers.  

Regarding your question on Assumption:
1. First, it guarantees that there is a non-overlapping part of the filter. In the first stage of our algorithm, we first learn this non-overlapping part and the second layer jointly.
2. In the second stage, using Assumption 3.2 we show P^{a} (page 7) has a lower bounded least eigenvalue.

The work seems interesting but is limited and as the authors mentioned it might be a good start for further investigation. However, what I really wanted to see was a simple comparison on a dataset like MNIST with conventional CNN being trained via SGD, for example.

First, we want to emphasize that this is a theory paper and the primary goal of this is paper is to broaden our knowledge on the learnability of convolutional neural networks. Prior work on learning this model via SGD/GD required stronger assumptions such as Gaussian input and no-overlap in the patches. Our techniques help us give strong guarantees under significantly weaker assumptions. 

Practically, we consider a simple layer by layer training which can be heuristically extended for deeper layers. For experiments, in this paper, we are specifically looking at the regression problem unlike the classification problem in MNIST. We do present experiments to show the validity of our approach on a synthetic dataset. 

We have fixed the typos that you mentioned. Thanks!

The algorithm works on any symmetric input data. The techniques in this paper combines two previous approaches: 1. the algorithm Convotron for learning a single convolutional filter (while the second layer has fixed weight) on any symmetric input distributions; 2. non-convex optimization for low rank matrix factorization.

The main observation in the paper is that if the overlap in the convolutions is not large (in the sense that each location of the convolution has at least one input coordinate that is not used in any other locations), then the weight that corresponds to the non-overlapping part and the weights in the second layer can be computed by a matrix factorization step (the paper gives a way to estimate a gradient that is similar to the gradient for a linear neural network, and then the problem is very similar to a rank-1 matrix factorization). After this step, we know the second layer and the algorithm can generalize the previous Convotron algorithm to learn the full convolutional filter.

This is an interesting observation that allows the algorithm to learn a two-layer neural network. On the other hand this two layer neural network is still a bit limited as there is still only one convolutional filter, and in particular there is only one local and global optimum (up to scaling the two layers). The observation also limited how much the patches can overlap which was not a problem in the original convotron algorithm. 

Overall I feel the paper is interesting but a bit incremental.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SyltPVgnam" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Response</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkMnHjC5YQ&amp;noteId=SyltPVgnam"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper124 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">16 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper124 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thanks for your feedback. We would like to emphasize the following points.

First, the generalization of Convotron [1] to handle approximately known weights in the second layer is highly non-trivial. It requires an analysis of the new patch matrix that is weighted by the coefficients. We use a substantially different technique from [1] to show the given property. In particular, we use properties of Toeplitz matrices which might be of independent interest. 

Second, prior work on learning the same architecture cannot handle any overlap, and in practice, less than half overlap is often used (patch size 3X3 with stride 2).

Third, our main goal of this paper to handle a broader class of convolutional neural networks that have 1) overlaps and 2) more than one layers. For multiple filters, to our knowledge, even the simplest case, the problem of learning a fully connected neural network has not been resolved yet. Nevertheless, once that problem is solved,  one can combine our approach to learn convolutional neural networks with multiple filters.
