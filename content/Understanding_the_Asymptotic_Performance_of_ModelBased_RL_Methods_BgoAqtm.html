This paper uses two MuJoCo environments to understand this gap through a series of ablation experiments designed to separate the contributions of the dynamics model and planner. These reveal the importance of long planning horizons, beyond those typically used. A dynamics model that directly predicts distant states, based on current state and a long sequence of actions, is introduced. This avoids the need for many recursions during long-range planning, and thus is able to yield more accurate state estimates. These accurate predictions allow us to uncover the relationship between model accuracy and performance, and translate to higher task reward that matches or exceeds current state-of-the-art model-free approaches.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">model-based reinforcement learning, mbrl, reinforcement learning, predictive models, predictive learning, forward models, deep learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Long-term prediction accuracy limits the performance of model-based RL, and can be improved with a simple change to the form of the model.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJl0oYGLp7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>More comprehensive comparison necessary</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1g29oAqtm&amp;noteId=BJl0oYGLp7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper571 AnonReviewer4</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">12 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper571 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper proposes to use a multi-step prediction model in model-based RL. The proposed model maps from current state and a sequence of actions to the state after taking those actions. The paper demonstrates on 2 tasks that in a model-predictive control loop combined with planning by cross-entropy method, this can yield better asymptotic performance than using single-step models.

The insight of using multi-step prediction models is certainly appealing and makes a lot of sense in deterministic tasks. A systematic empirical comparison of multi-step deep models in RL is of interest, which this paper does provide to some extent.

An obvious limitation of the proposed deterministic multi-step forward model is the restriction to deterministic systems. One would expect that the performance deteriorates quickly as the system becomes more stochastic. An extension to the stochastic case along the lines of Chua et al, 2018 is non-trivial as capturing the stochasticity is typically more challenging in long-term predictions. Yet, the paper makes an additional assumption that is less clearly communicated: To be able to plan with a R-step model, one needs to be able to evaluate or approximate the sum of R rewards just from the first and last state in that R-long sequence. This work uses simply the reward at the end r(s_{t+R}) as a proxy which works well in these MuJoCo tasks but can fail horribly in others. One can imagine that a model not only outputs s_{t+R} but also the sum of R rewards given s_t and a_{t:t+R} which could work in more general settings but this is not explored in this paper. The contribution in this paper limited as the proposed approach as well as the experimental comparison is restricted to a relatively specific class of problems and no attempts to generalize are made.

The experiments nicely compare against using single-step dynamics models and the results show that using the multi-step models for MPC performs better in the two considered tasks. However, as fas as I understand both the ACP and Chua et al baseline using the single-step prediction accuracy to train their models. The paper is missing a comparison to single-step models that are trained using multi-step prediction losses ("backprop through time" as in Learning Nonlinear Dynamic Models by Langford et al 2009). These models should be much more robust to error blow-up for multi-step prediction and do not require the specific reward structure assumed in this paper.

The proposed R-step model-based RL approach could be connected to the use of options (the planner and model operate on R-step options, but the MPC does update the policy after every time step). It would be interesting to discuss this potential connection in the paper. The paper does a good job of discussing existing recent work in the deep RL literature but it would also be good to also discuss earlier work on multi-step prediction (e.g. in time-series modeling).

All in all, I think the paper makes a small contribution demonstrating that multi-step models are useful for model-based RL in specific domains -- which is interesting but certainly not surprising. Unfortunately the paper stops somewhat early by not comparing to relevant baselines (single-step models trained with multi-step losses) and by not considering tasks where the benefit of multi-step planning would be less clear.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BkghGs6ZpQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Incremental advance on model-based reinforcement learning methods</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1g29oAqtm&amp;noteId=BkghGs6ZpQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper571 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">08 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper571 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors learn a model that predicts the state R steps in the future, given the current state and intervening actions, instead of the predicting the next time step state. The model is then used for standard model predictive control. The authors find numerically that their method, termed Plan-Conditional Predictor (PCP), performs better over long horizon times (~100 time steps), than other recent model-based and model-free algorithms. This because for long horizon time scales, the model predicting the state for the next time step accumulates error when used recursively.

The key idea is to use a model that directly predicts multiple time steps into the future. While seemingly an obvious extension, it does not appear to have been used in current algorithms. A main issue that I find with this approach is: since only the state after R steps is predicted, reward r(s_t,a_t) can only be used every R steps, not at every step. The authors gloss over this issue because for both MuJoCo environments that they tested, they only need to consider reward at the end of the planning horizon. Thus to make their algorithm generally applicable, the authors also need to show how or whether their method can deal with rewards that may appear at any time step.

Further, rather than speculate on the cause of the difference between their PCP and PETS (Chua et al 2018) on half-cheetah to be their different settings for CEM optimization (Fig 7b), the authors should just use the same settings to compare. Possibly the authors ran out of time to do this for the current submission, but should certainly do it for the final version.

While the authors have already compared to other algorithms with similar aims, eg Chua et al 2018, they may also wish to compare to a recent preprint Clavera et al Sep 2018, which also aims to combine the sample efficiency of model-based methods while achieving the performance of model-free ones, by using an ensemble of models, over a 200 time step horizon. However, given the recency of this algorithm, I don't consider this essential.

Overall, I feel that the authors idea of an R-step model is worth spreading in the community, if the above two main points are addressed. At the same time, I can only rate it at the border of the cutoff mark.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BkgF8SV53X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Model-based RL with action sequences, need more convincing regarding applicability</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1g29oAqtm&amp;noteId=BkgF8SV53X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper571 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper571 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes learning a transition model that takes an action sequence as an input (instead of a single action), and performing model-based planning by using the cross-entropy method.

One obvious concern with this is that this produces a sequence of open-loop plans, rather than a closed-loop policies, with all the inherent limitations. I could see this working well in practice in problems where anticipating how future decisions will react to state changes is not that important, however the authors should discuss the trade-offs more.

A larger concern for me revolves around learning the transition model. Taking the action sequence as an input (which is one of the main novelties in the paper) is likely to require a lot of data, and maybe this is fine on relatively simple Mujoco tasks but I see it as a potential issue when trying to expand this to more realistic problems.

Finally, I suggest that the authors change the title to something more descriptive of the paper’s contents, as there is no analysis of asymptotic performance in the paper (as I would have thought from the title). I also recommend that they look to see if there is any model-based work in the semi-MDP literature, which could be relevant here.
