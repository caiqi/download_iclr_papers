Recently, there has been an increasing interest in building models which can perform this task by learning from datasets containing triplets of the form \{plot, question, answer\}. Two such datasets have been proposed in the recent past which contain plots generated from synthetic data with limited (i) $x-y$ axes variables (ii) question templates and (iii) answer vocabulary and hence do not adequately capture the challenges posed by this task. To overcome these limitations of existing datasets, we introduce a new dataset containing $9.7$ million question-answer pairs grounded over $270,000$ plots with three main differentiators. First, the plots in our dataset contain a wide variety of realistic $x$-$y$ variables such as CO2 emission, fertility rate, \textit{etc.} extracted from  real word data sources such as World Bank, government sites, \textit{etc}. Second, the questions in our dataset are more complex as they are based on templates extracted from interesting questions asked by a crowd of workers using a fraction of these plots. Lastly, the answers in our dataset are not restricted to a small vocabulary and a large fraction of the answers seen at test time are not present in the training vocabulary. As a result, existing models for Visual Question Answering which largely use end-to-end models in a multi-class classification framework cannot be used for this task. We establish initial results on this dataset and emphasize the complexity of the task using a multi-staged modular pipeline with various sub-components to (i) extract relevant data from the plot and convert it to a semi-structured table (ii) combine the question with this table and use compositional semantic parsing to arrive at a logical form from which the answer can be derived. We believe that such a modular framework is the best way to go forward as it would enable the research community to independently make progress on all the sub-tasks involved in plot question answering.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">VQA, Data Interpretation, Parsing, Object Detection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We created a new dataset for data interpretation over plots and also propose a baseline for the same.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BygfEQSpaX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Submission Withdrawn by the Authors</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygeznA9YX&amp;noteId=BygfEQSpaX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1231 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">17 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1231 Withdraw Submission</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Withdrawal confirmation: </span><span class="note_content_value">I have read and agree with the withdrawal statement on behalf of myself and my co-authors.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1luMkqcnX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A large visual QA on plots dataset that should be useful</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygeznA9YX&amp;noteId=S1luMkqcnX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1231 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1231 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">


The authors propose a large dataset for the task of visual
understanding of plots. Compared to the two previous datasets recently
published (FigureQA and DVQA), their proposed dataset (DIP) involves a
significantly larger vocabulary, and realistic words, and the
questions and answers (as well as plots) can be more diverse and
complex.

The novelty of the work lies (see below) in some aspects of creating
the data, though new ideas are somewhat marginal, considering the work on previous
datasets. The paper is clearly written.  I think the dataset will be very useful.


-- Because all questions are generated via templates in particular
   (and plots also follow a certain generation process, albeit noisy),
   I am concerned that it would ultimately be easy to invert the
   process to crack the dataset. Any intuitions why this is unlikely?
   For instance, eventually Jeopardy was tackled (better than human
   champion) with a large engineered system..

-- Please provide example mistakes of techniques you tried, eg on the 
table answering problem. 

-- Section 5: why not report performance on the 'test-hard' split (in
   supplementary), since it's mentioned at all?

-- What is the human performance on your data? Some rough accuracy
rates will be useful, preferably on each question type.  This would
help understand the room for progress (This is done for FigureQA data).

-- minor: Why not use more sophisticated techniques (eg neural-based
   relation learning, the work is cited) for the last stage table
   reasoning?


Ideas, novelty: unlike previous work, the plots are generated from
real tables (world bank, open government data, ...) and Amazon Turk
workers are asked to come up with relatively complex questions, for a
small subset of the generated plots.  Templates for these questions
are then generated (with some extensive manual work to make sure the
questions feel natural), and many plots (270k) and questions (~10
million) are then generated using plot generation and the templates.

The performances reported are via breaking the problem into stages,
using several techniques in a pipeline, from visual elements detection
to OCR, to table reconstruction, finally table QA. Standard
techniques (to best of my knowledge) were used for each stage to
report a baseline performance.

This paper introduces a new dataset for the DIP problem. The authors develop a pipeline that break down the task into two step, to learn from this dataset. 

In general, this paper is well-written. I am able to understand the DIP problem, the dataset and the proposed pipeline. 

The process of constructing the DIP dataset looks reasonable. The strategy adopted in the proposed pipeline, which break down the task into two step, looks interesting. However, I do not consider this strategy completely novel, since each component of the proposed pipeline is based on existing method.

My major concerns about this paper might be related to the experiments. In the paper, the authors claim that the dataset is very challenging and beyond existing end-to-end models. I believe this claim might be true; however, I think the authors should still support this claim with experiments, even if end-to-end models give very poor results. I would also suggest the authors test the proposed method on easier dataset, such that it can be fairly compared with existing methods. 

In summary, I think this paper is an OK paper, although it can be further improved if more experimental results are provided.

I found a typo in the paper.

Paper summary:

The paper is concerned with algorithms that can interpret data shown
in scientific plots. The algorithm is given a plot and a question, and
is required to predict an answer. The main contribution of this paper
is a new (synthetic) data set which is much larger than previous data
sets. It is claimed that the proposed DIP data set is "more realistic"
than previous data sets. (in terms of variable names, values,
questions) The paper also proposes a baseline model/pipeline for these
data. 

The paper proposes the (new?) idea of using crowdsourced workers to
create natural language questions. 3500 plots were each shown to 5
different works, creating a total of 17,500 questions. After that, the
authors manually clustered the questions into 5 classes and 74
templates, from which they generated the DIP data set. It contains
273,821 plots (presumably with

The model (pipeline) consists of four sub-tasks:
- visual element detection, which consists of predicting bounding boxes for axis labels, tick marks, legends, etc. A Single Shot Multibox Detector model is trained for this task.
- optical character recognition is performed using a pre-trained OCR model.
- Semi-structured information extraction is performed using is done using a "use the closest" heuristic.
- table question answering using a previous method.

Detailed comments:

The main strong point of the paper is the manually collected
crowdsource data. The paper is also quite clear and easy to read and
understand.

However there are too many weak points to merit publication.

It is clear that the model is NOT a significant contribution to the
machine learning literature, as it simply uses previous work.

It is not clear that the data set is a significant contribution to the machine
learning literature. Machine learning has made progress in recent
years because of the emphasis on analyzing real (not synthetic)
benchmark data sets, in which the pattern is unknown. If this kind of
synthetic data is interesting in another field of research, maybe this
paper could be resubmitted elsewhere in the current form?

Otherwise, publishing the full data that were actually collected from
real people (not synthetically generated) is a productive research
direction for the machine learning community. Would that be possible?

If you really want to train on synthetic data, then the interesting
question is, can you train on your synthetic data and then get good
results on the real data (test-hard) from crowdsourced workers? This
question is not answered in the paper. "However, we do not use the
test-hard split for our experiments." why not?

Why does the test-hard data set only have 1000 observations? Why not
use the entire set of 17,500 that you gathered?

A weak point is that the paper offers no empirical comparison with
previous models, and simply claims that they are not good enough. "it
is infeasible to use any of the existing VQA models on our dataset as
they largely treat VQA as a multi-class classification problem where
the task is to select the right answer from a fixed vocabulary"

Figures are not publication quality. In particular the text in figures
1c, 2 is too small to read.

Tables are not publication quality. Table 1 has a confusing comma on
the first(train) line -- is there a missing number? Tables 2-5 need
Standard deviations or confidence intervals. You should use K-fold
cross validation instead of a fixed train/validation/test split. In
practice you can do that by publishing a file with a suggested Fold ID
(say from 1 to 5) for each observation.

"The data contains positive integers, floating point values,
percentages and values on a linear scale." -- what is a value on a
linear scale?
