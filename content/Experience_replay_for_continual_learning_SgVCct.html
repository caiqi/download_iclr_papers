Neural networks trained by stochastic gradient descent often degrade on old tasks when trained successively on new tasks with different data distributions. This phenomenon, referred to as catastrophic forgetting, is considered a major hurdle to learning with non-stationary data or sequences of new tasks, and prevents networks from continually accumulating knowledge and skills. We examine this issue in the context of reinforcement learning, in a setting where an agent is exposed to tasks in a sequence. Unlike most other work, we do not provide an explicit indication to the model of task boundaries, which is the most general circumstance for a learning agent exposed to continuous experience. While various methods to counteract catastrophic forgetting have recently been proposed, we explore a straightforward, general, and seemingly overlooked solution - that of using experience replay buffers for all past events - with a mixture of on- and off-policy learning, leveraging behavioral cloning. We show that this strategy can still learn new tasks quickly yet can substantially reduce catastrophic forgetting in both Atari and DMLab domains, even matching the performance of methods that require task identities. When buffer storage is constrained, we confirm that a simple mechanism for randomly discarding data allows a limited size buffer to perform almost as well as an unbounded one.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, lifelong learning, behavioral cloning, reinforcement learning, interference, stability-plasticity</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We show that, in continual learning settings, catastrophic forgetting can be avoided by applying off-policy RL to a mixture of new and replay experience, with a behavioral cloning loss.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Skg0ier92Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Solid Paper, but Novelty over Experience Replay Needs Better Motivation</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1g2V3Cct7&amp;noteId=Skg0ier92Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1488 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1488 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes a particular variant of experience replay with behavior cloning as a method for continual learning. The approach achieves good performance while not requiring a task label. This paper makes the point that I definitely agree with that all of the approaches being considered should compare to experience replay and that in reality many of them rarely do better. However, I am not totally convinced when it comes to the value of the actual novel aspects of this paper. 

Much of the empirical analysis of experience replay (i.e. the buffer size, the ratio of past and novel experiences, etc…) was not surprising or particular novel in my eyes. The idea of using behavior cloning is motivated fully through the lens of catastrophic forgetting and promoting stability and does not at all address achieving plasticity. This was interesting to me as the authors do mention the stability-plasticity dilemma, but a more theoretical analysis of why behavior cloning is somehow the right method among various choices to promote stability while not sacrificing or improving plasticity was definitely missing for me. Other options can certainly be considered as well if your aim is just to add stability to experience replay such a notion of weight importance for the past like in EwC (Kirkpatric et al., 2017) and many other papers or using knowledge distillation like LwF (Li and Hoeim, 2016). LwF in particular seems quite related. I wonder how LwF + experience replay compares to the approach proposed here. In general the discourse could become a lot strong in my eyes if it really considered various alternatives and explained why behavior cloning provides theoretical value. 

Overall, behavior cloning seems to help a little bit based on the experiments provided, but this finding is very likely indicative of the particular problem setting and seemingly not really a game changer. In the paper, they explore settings with fairly prolonged periods of training in each RL domain one at a time. If the problem was to become more non-stationary with more frequent switching (i.e. more in line with the motivation of lifelong learning), I would imagine that increasing stability is not necessarily a good thing and may slow down future learning.

The core concept of the method is utilizing experience replay buffer for all past events with new experience. They mainly worked on their method in the setting of reinforcement learning. In the experiments, they show that the model successfully mitigate the catastrophic forgetting with this behavioral cloning, and has the performance comparable to recent continual learning approaches.

The paper is easy to follow, and the methodology is quite intuitive and straight forward. In this paper, I have several questions.

Q1. I wonder the reason that every tasks are trained cyclically in sequence. And is there any trial to learn each task just once and observe the catastrophic forgetting of them when they have to detain the learned knowledge in a long time without training them again, as does most of visual domain experiments of the other continual learning research.

Q2. In figure 5, I wonder why the natlab_varying_map_ramdomize(probe task) can perform well even they didn’t learn yet. The score of brown line increases nearly 60~70% of final score(after trained) during training the first task. Because the tasks are deeply correlated? or it is just common property of probe task?

Q3. Using reservoir(buffer) to prevent catastrophic forgetting is natural and reasonable. Is there some of quantitative comparison in the sense of memory requirement and runtime? I feel that 5 or 50 million experiences at each task are huge enough to memorize and manage.

Additionally, in the experiment of figure 5, I think it could be much clear with a verification that the probe task  is semantically independent (no interference) over all the other tasks. 

Also, it is quite hard to compare the performance of the models just with plots. I expect that it could be much better to show some of quantitative  results(as number).</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Hklq4yMYn7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Reduction in Catastrophic Forgetting by Augmented Experience Replay</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1g2V3Cct7&amp;noteId=Hklq4yMYn7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1488 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1488 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors propose an approach to augment experience replay buffers with properties that can alleviate issues with catastrophic forgetting. The buffers are augmented by storing both new and historical experiences, along with the desired historical policy &amp; value distribution. The AC learning now couples two additional losses that ensures the new policy does not drift away from old actor distribution (via KL) and new value does not drift away from old critic distribution (via L2 loss).

The authors provided clear experimental evidence that shows how an RL agent that does not use CLEAR will observe catastrophic when we sequentially train different tasks (and it is not due to destructive interference using the simultaneous and separate training/evaluation experiments). Author also showed how different replay make ups can change the result of CLEAR (and it's a matter of empirical tuning).

The formulation of CLEAR also is simple while delivering interesting results. It would have been nice to see how this is used in a practical setting as all these are synthetic environments / tasks. The discussion on relationship with biological mechanism also seems unnecessary as it's unclear whether the mechanism proposed is actually what's in the CLS.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
