However, applications which could benefit from this generative power, such as image manipulation, are hindered by the lack of controlling specific interpretable factors in the latent space of the learned models. Guiding the sampling process to produce sample variation which is semantically disentangled and meaningful for humans is not possible with current generative models unless large amounts of attribute labelled data are available. In this paper, we propose Unlabeled Disentangling GAN (UD-GAN), which decomposes the latent noise space into semantically meaningful dimensions, using only weak supervision, and without using labels or explicit attributes. When we sample a new data point we can independently control each latent noise slice of UD-GAN and manipulate in a targeted fashion the properties of generated data. Our contributions encompass the introduction of our novel architecture combining an adversarial with contrastive loss, an analysis and probabilistic interpretation of the loss function, and multiple experiments to illustrate the capabilities of our method.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">GAN, disentange, siamese networks, semantic</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We use Siamese Networks to control and disentangle the generation process in GANs without labeled data.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HyeZp_ivTQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting idea but incomplete justifications</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1e0-30qKm&amp;noteId=HyeZp_ivTQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1220 AnonReviewer5</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">13 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1220 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposed a GAN that learns a disentangled factors of variations in unsupervised (or weakly-supervised) manner. To this end, the proposed method incorporates a contrastive loss together with Siamese network, which encourages the generator to output smaller variations in samples if they are drawn by varying the same latent factors. The proposed idea is evaluated on simple datasets such as MNIST and centered faces, and show that it is able to learn disentangled latent codes by incorporating some heuristics. 

Although the paper presents an interesting and reasonable idea, I think the paper is incomplete and in the proof-of-concept stage. In terms of method, the guidance for learning Siamese networks are designed heuristically (e.g. edges, colors, etc.) which limits its applicability over various datasets; I think that designing more principled approach to build such guidances from data should be one of the key contributions of the paper. In terms of evaluation, the authors only presented a few qualitative results on simple datasets, which is not comprehensive and convincing. 

In conclusion, I suggest a reject of this paper due to the lacks of comprehensive study and evaluation.

Summary
-------------------------------
This paper proposes to learn disentangled latent states under the GAN framework. The core idea is to partition the latent states into N partitions, and correspondly have N Siamese networks that pull the generated images with the same latent partition towards each other, along with a contrastive loss which ensures generated images with different latent partitions to be different. The authors experiment with two setups: in the "unguided setup" training is completely unsupervised, while in the "guided" setup, there is some weak supervision to encourage different partitions to learn different factors.

-------------------------------
Evaluation
-------------------------------
While the motivation is nice, I find the results (especially in the unguided setup) underwhelming. This does not seem surprising to me, as in the unguided case, the constrative loss seems not strong enough to encourage the latent partitions to be different. Results with weak supervision (their method for injecting weak supervision was very nice) are more impressive. However, there is no comparison against existing work. Learning disentangled representations with deep generative models is very much an active area. Here are some recent papers:

Importantly, there are no quantitative metrics. I do not think this work is ready for publication.

The key idea is to use siamese networks with contrastive loss. Specifically, it decomposes the latent code to a set of knobs (sub part of the latent code). Each time it renders different images with different configurations of the knobs. For example, 1) as changing one knob while keeping the others, it expects it would only result in change of one attribute in the image, and 2) as keeping one knob while changing all the others, it expects it would result in large change of image appearances. The relative magnitude of change for 1) and 2) justifies the use of a Siamese network in addition to the image discriminator in the standard GAN framework. The paper further talks about how to use inductive bias to design the Siamese network so that it can control the semantic meaning of a particular knob. 

While I do like the idea, I think the paper is still in the early stage. First of all, the paper does not include any numerical evaluation. It only shows a couple of examples. It is unclear how well the proposed method works in general. In addition, the InfoGAN work is designed  for the same functionality. The paper should compare the proposed work to the InfoGAN work both quantitatively and qualitatively to justify its novelty. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1xX2I782m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting problem but limited approach and evaluation</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1e0-30qKm&amp;noteId=H1xX2I782m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1220 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">31 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1220 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary

The paper presents a novel approach for learning a generative model where different factors of variations can be independently manipulated. The method is build upon  the GAN framework where the latent variables are divided into different subsets (chunks) which are expected to encode information about high-level factors of variation. To this end, a Siamese Network for each chunk is trained with a contrastive loss minimizing the distance between generated images sharing the same factor (the latent variables in the chunk are equal), and maximizing the distance between pairs where the latent variables differ. Given that the proposed model fails in this fully-unsupervised setting, the authors propose to add weak-supervision into the model by forcing the Siamese networks to  focus only on particular aspects of generated images (e.g, color, edges, etc..). This is achieved by applying  a basic transformation  over the input images in order to remove specific information. The evaluation of the  proposed model is carried out using the MS-Celeb dataset where the authors provide qualitative results.


Methodology

*Disentangling generative factors without explicit labels is a challenging and interesting problem. The idea of dividing the latent representation in different subsets and using a proxy task involving triplets of images has been already explored in [3]. However, the use of Siamese networks in this context is novel and sound.

*As shown in the reported results, the proposed method fails to learn meaningful factors in the unsupervised setting. However, the authors do not provide an in-depth discussion of this phenomena. Given that previous works [1,2,3] have successfully addressed this problem using a completely unsupervised approach, it would be necessary to give more insights about: (i) why the proposed method is failing (ii) why this negative result is interesting and (iii) if the method could be useful in other potential scenarios. 

*The strategy proposed to introduce weak-supervision is too ad-hoc. I agree that using cues such as the average color of an image can be useful if we want to model basic factors of variation. However, it is unclear how a similar strategy could be applied if we are interested in learning variables with higher-level semantics such as the expression of a face or its pose.

*As far as I understand, the transformations applied to the input images (e.g, edge detection) must be differentiable (given that it is necessary to backpropagate the gradient of the contrastive loss through the generator network). If this is the case, this should be properly discussed in the paper. Moreover, given that the amount of differentiable transformations is reduced, this also limits the application of the proposed method for more interesting scenarios. 

*It is not clear why the latent variables modelling the generative factors are defined using a Gaussian prior. How the case where two images have a very similar latent factor is avoided while generating pairs of images for the Siamese network?  Have the authors considered to use categorical or binary variables? The use of the contrastive loss sounds more appropriate in this case.


Experimental results

*The experimental section is too limited. First of all, only a small number of qualitative results are reported and, therefore, it is very difficult to assess the proposed method and draw any conclusion. For example, when the edge extractor is used, what kind of information is modeled by the latent variables? Is it consistent across different samples?

Moreover, it is not clear why the authors have limited the evaluation to the case where only two “chunks” are used. In principle, the method could be applied with many more subsets of latent variables and then manually inspect them to check it they are semantically meaningful (see [2]) 

*As previously mentioned, there are many recent works addressing the same problem from a fully-unsupervised perspective [1,2,3]. All these works provide quantitative results evaluating the learned representations by using them to predict real labels (e.g, attributes in the CelebA data-set). The authors could provide a similar evaluation for their method by using the feature representations learned by the siamese networks in order to evaluate how much information they convey about real factors of variation. This could clarify the advantages of the weakly-supervised strategy compared to unsupervised approaches.

Review summary

+The addressed problem (learning disentangled representations without explicit labeling) is challenging and interesting.

+The idea of using a proxy task (contrastive loss with triplets of generated images) is somewhat novel and promising.

- The authors report only negative results for the fully-unsupervised version of UD-GAN The paper lacks and in-depth discussion about why this negative result is interesting.

-The strategy proposed to provide weak-supervision to the model is too ad-hoc and it is not clear how to apply it in general applications

-The experimental section do not clarify the benefits of the proposed approach. In particular, the qualitative results are too limited and no quantitative evaluations is provided.
