Summary:
The paper proposed to incorporate a manifold regularization penalty to the GAN to adapt to semi-supervised learning. They approximate this penalty empirically by calculating stochastic finite differences of the generator’s latent variables. 
The paper does a good job of motivating the additional regularization penalty and their approximation to it with a series of experiments and intuitive explanations. The experiment results are very through and overall promising. The paper is presented in a clear manner with only minor issues. 
Novelty/Significance:
The authors’ add a manifold regularization penalty to GAN discriminator’s loss function. While this is a simple and seemingly obvious approach, it had to be done by someone. Thus while I don’t think their algorithm is super novel, it is significant and thus novel enough. Additionally, the authors’ use of gradients of the generator as an approximation for the manifold penalty is a clever.
Questions/Clarity:
It would be helpful to note in the description of Table 3 what is better (higher/lower). Also Table 3 seems to have standard deviations missing in Supervised DCGANs and Improved GAN for 4000 labels. And is there an explanation on why there isn’t an improvement in the FID score of SVHN for 1000 labels?
What is the first line of Table 4? Is it supposed to be combined with the second? If not, then it is missing results. And is the Pi model missing results or can it not be run on too few labels? If it can’t be run, it would be helpful to state this.
On page 11, “in Figure A2” the first word needs to be capitalized. 
In Figure A1, why is there a dark point at one point in the inner circle? What makes the gradient super high there?
What are the differences of the 6 pictures in Figure A7? Iterations?

The proposed regularization strategy enforces that a discriminator or a given classifier should be invariant to small perturbations on the data manifold z. It is empirically shown that naively enforcing such a constraint by randomly adding noise to z could lead to under-smoothing or over-smoothing in some cases which can harm the final classification performance. Consequently, the proposed regularization technique takes a step of tunable size in the direction of the manifold gradient, which has the effect of smoothing along the direction of the gradient while ignoring its norm.
 
Extensive experiments have been conducted, showing that the proposed approach
outperforms or is comparable with recent state-of-the-art approaches on cifar 10, especially in presence of fewer labelled data points. On SVHN however, the proposed approach fails in comparison with (Kumar et al 2017) but performs better than other approaches.

Furthermore, it has been shown that adding the proposed manifold regularization technique to the training of GAN greatly improves the image quality of generated images (in terms of FID scores and inception scores). Also, by combining the proposed regularizer with a classical supervised classifier (via pre-training a GAN and using it for regularization) decreases classification error by 2 to 3%.
 
Finally, it has also been shown that after training a GAN using the manifold regularization, the algorithm is able to produce similar images giving a low enough perturbation of the data manifold z.
 
Overall, this paper is well written and show significant improvements especially for image generation. However, the novelty is rather limited as similar ideas have been undertaken (e.g., Mescheder et al 2018), but in different contexts. The paper would be improved if the following points are taken into account:
 
A comparison with Graph Convolutional Network based techniques seems appropriate (e.g. Kipf and Welling 2017).
How do the FID/Inception improvements compare to (Mescheder et al 2018)?
It would be interesting to discuss why the FID score for SVHN gets worse in presence of 1000 labels.
Although there is a clear improvement in FID scores for Cifar10. It would be informative to show the generated images w/ and w/o manifold regularization.
More analysis should be provided on why (Kumar et al 2017) perform so well on SVHN.
It should be stated that bold values in tables do not represent best results (as it is usually the case) but rather results for the proposed approach.

They proposed a manifold regularization by approximating the Laplacian norm using the stochastic finite difference. The motivation is that making the classifier invariant to perturbations along the manifold is more reasonable than random perturbations. The idea is to use GAN to learn the manifold. The difficulty is that (the gradient of) Laplacian norm is impractical to compute for DNNs. They stated that another approximation of the manifold gradient, i.e. adding Gaussian noise \delta to z directly (||f(z) - f(g(z+\delta))||_F) has some drawbacks when the magnitude of noise is too large or too small. The authors proposed another improved gradient approximation by first computing the normalized manifold gradient \bar r(z) and then adding a tunable magnitude of \bar r(z) to g(z), i.e., ||f(z) - f(g(z) +\epsilon \bar r(z) )||_F. Since several previous works Kumar et al. (2017) and Qi et al. (2018) also applied the idea of manifold regularization into GAN, the authors pointed out several advantages of their new regularization.

Pros:
- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow. It gives some intuitive explanations of why their method works.
- The idea is simple and easy to implement based on a standard GAN.
- The authors conduct various experiments to show the interaction of the regularization and the generator.

Cons:
- For semi-supervised classification, the paper did not report the best results in other baselines. E.g., in Table 1 and 2,  the best result of VAT (Miyato et al., 2017) is VAT+Ent, 13.15 for CIFAR-10 (4000 labels) and 4.28 for SVHN (1000 labels). The performance of the proposed method is worse than the previous work but they claimed "state-of-the-art" results. The paper also misses several powerful baselines of semi-supervised learning, e.g. [1,2]. The experimental results are not very convincing because many importance baselines are neglected.
- The paper does not have a significant novel contribution, but rather extends GANs (improved-GAN mostly) with a manifold regularization, which has been explored in many other works Kumar et al. (2017) and Qi et al. (2018). 

I'm wondering whether other smoothness regularizations can achieve the same effect when applied to semi-supervised learning, e.g. spectral normalization[3]. It would be better to compare with them.
