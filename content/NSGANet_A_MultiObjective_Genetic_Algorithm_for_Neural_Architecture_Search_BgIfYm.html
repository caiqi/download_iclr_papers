NSGA-Net is designed with three goals in mind: (1) a NAS procedure for multiple, possibly conflicting, objectives, (2) efficient exploration and exploitation of the space of potential neural network architectures, and (3) output of a diverse set of network architectures spanning a trade-off frontier of the objectives in a single run. NSGA-Net is a population-based search algorithm that explores a space of potential neural network architectures in three steps, namely, a population initialization step that is based on prior-knowledge from hand-crafted architectures, an exploration step comprising crossover and mutation of architectures and finally an exploitation step that applies the entire history of evaluated neural architectures in the form of a Bayesian Network prior. Experimental results suggest that combining the objectives of minimizing both an error metric and computational complexity, as measured by FLOPS, allows NSGA-Net to find competitive neural architectures near the Pareto front of both objectives on two different tasks, object classification and object alignment. NSGA-Net obtains networks that achieve 3.72% (at 4.5 million FLOP) error on CIFAR-10 classification and 8.64% (at 26.6 million FLOP) error on the CMU-Car alignment task.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">neural architecture search, evolutionary algorithms</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">An efficient multi-objective neural architecture search algorithm using NSGA-II</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Hyl0mlAch7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A combination of architecture search ideas</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1gIf305Ym&amp;noteId=Hyl0mlAch7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1266 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1266 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes a search method for neural network architectures such that two (potentially) conflicting objectives: maximization of final performance and minimization of computational complexity can be pursued simultaneously. The motivation for the approach is that a principled multiobjective search procedure (NSGA-II) makes it unnecessary to manually find the right trade-off between two objectives, and simultaneously finds several solutions spanning the tradeoff. It is also capable of finding solutions from the concave regions of the Pareto-front. Multiobjective search for architectures has been explored in recent work, so the primary contribution of this paper is to show its utility in a more general and perhaps more powerful setting.

The paper is clearly written and is easy to understand, except that the parenthetical citations used appear to differ from the ICLR style and cause confusion. The authors delve into details of the approach though many aspects are from past work. I think that this makes the paper more self-contained and easy to understand, even if it makes the paper longer than the suggested length of 8 pages. I also found the comparisons and ablations shown in Figures 8 and 9 to be useful and informative. 

However, based on the presented results on the CIFAR-10 dataset (which can be compared to past work), I am not convinced of the utility of multiobjective optimisation for architecture search. There are a few reasons for this:

1. The best architectures found by previous methods in the literature are already at a similar or better accuracy. It appears that NSGA-Net did not succeed in finding architectures that a) outperform past results with higher FLOPs, or b) match past results with fewer FLOPs. I understand that in principle, a benefit of NSGA-Net is that other solutions with lower accuracy and fewer FLOPs are also found simultaneously, but these models are not discussed or analysed much in detail. What precisely is the utility of the proposed method then? This consideration is also complicated by the next point.

2. For the evaluation in the paper, the network with the lowest accuracy is extrapolated — the number of filters in each layer are increased and the network is retrained. Is this procedure justified in general? How to know the best increasing factor? 
Since lowering the computational cost is an objective of the search, changing the cost of an obtained solution does not seem principled.  Moreover, changing network sizes will affect any ordering of networks by accuracy since optimal hyperparameters for both optimization and regularization may change. In general, it is rather difficult to decouple hyperparameter search from architecture search.

3. A baseline that is missing in the paper is hyperparameter search, which can often yield very good performance for a given architecture. Tuning regularization in particular is often crucial. Since NSGA-Net trains 1200 networks, a comparable search would consider a known architecture e.g. Densenet and allocate 200 trials each to 6 architectures of different FLOPS (or 100 each to 12 architectures). How effective is this simple procedure at obtaining a good tradeoff front?

Due to these concerns, I am presently unconvinced by the results in this paper, though I think that in general multiobjective optimization of architectures should be a fruitful direction. 

Minor question: Figure 9(b) indicates that experiments were also conducted on the SVHN and MNIST datasets. Why are these results not reported?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BklhkyjYnX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>The proposed method is interesting and promising approach, but the contribution is not clear. </a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1gIf305Ym&amp;noteId=BklhkyjYnX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1266 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1266 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">
- Summary
This paper proposes an evolutionary-based method for the multi-objective neural architecture search, where the proposed method aims at minimizing two objectives: an error metric and the number of FLOPS. The proposed method consists of an exploration step and an exploitation step. In the exploration step, architectures are sampled by using genetic operators such as the crossover and the mutation. In the exploitation step, architectures are generated by a Bayesian Network. The proposed method is evaluated on object classification and object alignment tasks.

- Pros
  - The performance of the proposed method is better than the existing multi-objective architecture search methods in the object classification task.
  - The effect of each proposed technique is appropriately evaluated. 

- Cons
  - The contribution of the proposed method is not clear to me. The proposed method is compared with the existing multi-objective methods in terms of classification accuracy, but if we focus on that point, the performance (i.e., error rate and FLOPs) of the proposed method is almost the same as those of the random search judging from Table 4. It would be better to compare the proposed method to the existing multi-objective methods in terms of classification accuracy and other objectives.
  - This paper argues that the choice of the number of parameters is sub-optimal and ineffective in terms of computational complexity. Please provide more details about this point. For example, what is the drawbacks of the number of parameters, what is the advantages of FLOPs for multi-objective optimization?
  - Please elaborate on the procedure and settings of the Bayesian network used in this paper.
  - It would be better to provide discussions of recent neural architecture search methods solving the single-objective problem.

I can not accept the paper in its current form.

In short, I have the following main criticisms:
1. use of crowding distance(CD) instead of hypervolume-contribution.
CD is not consistent with the HV estimator, especially CD might remove solutions that have a large HV-contribution and thus HV will not increase monotonically. The effect is even visible in Figure 8c) as in iteration 22, HV is decreasing as crowding distance removes a good offspring. In short: Crowding distance should not be used as long as the number of objectives does not prohibit computing the HV-contribution.

2. No good justification of BN. It is unclear to me why BN should be used instead of more iterations at stage 1. In 4.4 BN is only compared to the uniform initialization, but this comparison has no meaning given that we already have an optimized front that improved on the uniformly sampled distribution. To be honest, the samples shown from BN do not look very convincing as a lot of very poor architectures are created.

A proper comparison would be comparing the 2-step approach with only the first step and the same budget. Then we could compare samples from both distributions (either sampling from the front using mutation/crossover or sampling from BN). Also we would have a fair comparison of the obtained fronts and HV-values.

3. Ablation study cross-over
I am not convinced by the results presented. The paper says this is a "small scale" study but does not give the number of iterations/samples. It is clear that in the setup of the mutation operator cross-over might help, simply because it can change many more connections in a single iteration than mutation alone, which is limited to max 1 change. Allowing up to two mutations and no crossover could already proof to be better (orsmaller size of offspring population, see below)


Smaller concerns:

1. The results suggest that the uniform distribution might not be tuned well, as it only covers the "expensive" networks but not the "cheap" networks. A better initialization scheme that covers the x-axis better might already show vastly different results. As the Flop-objective is cheap to compute and does not require simulation, one could expect to tune this offline before initialization.

2. No handling of Noise.
During optimization, the chosen starting point and SGD algorithm will introduce noise into the process. Thus, the final test accuracy will be noisy. As an elitist dominance scheme is used, one might easily end up with an architecture that has a large variance when trained, i.e. when performing a final training pass on the full dataset, the performance might be very different. Moreover, the algorithm might stop convergence towards the true pareto front as it is held back by noisy "good" results. This should be discussed in the paper

3. A single-offspring approach might be better than sampling a full population (or offspring size in the order of parallel instances one can expend to run). 40 sounds excessive given that the sampling distribution is only improved through selection and given that the pareto front approximation appears to include less than 40 elements. This might also affect the results in the ablation study for cross-over: more iterations with reduced offspring size allows for more mutations of successful offspring.

4. Some unclear or wrong wordings:
page 4: "As a consequence[...] the best solution encountered [...] will always be present in the final population. " What do you consider "best" in a 2-objective problem? Do you mean: the best in each objective?
page 6, footnote1: this is not true. even without crossover the selection operator ties the solutions together, an offspring has to beat any point in the population, not necessarily its direct parent.

5. Figure 8a) does not include the state of the art result for CIFAR10, see for example
