Kernel two-sample test has been studied for this task which makes fewer assumptions on the distributions than traditional parametric approaches. However, selecting kernels is non-trivial in practice. Although kernel selection for the two-sample test has been studied, the insufficient samples in change point detection problem hinder the success of those developed kernel selection algorithms. In this paper, we propose KL-CPD, a novel kernel learning framework for time series CPD that optimizes a lower bound of test power via an auxiliary generative model. With deep kernel parameterization, KL-CPD endows kernel two-sample test with the data-driven kernel to detect different types of change-points in real-world applications. The proposed approach significantly outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in our comparative evaluation of benchmark datasets and simulation studies.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">deep kernel learning, generative models, kernel two-sample test, time series change-point detection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">In this paper, we propose KL-CPD, a novel kernel learning framework for time series CPD that optimizes a lower bound of test power via an auxiliary generative model as a surrogate to the abnormal distribution. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">7 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJxw5aOa2m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A very neat idea with strong results</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1GbfhRqF7&amp;noteId=BJxw5aOa2m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1239 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1239 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">+ Using a generative model as the surrogate distribution for kernel two-sample test is novel

- It is true that for some real-world applications, real-time CPD should be applied where only past samples are observed and anomaly alarm should be made immediately after observing a new sample. This paper, on the other hand, focuses on retrospective CPD where samples from both directions (past and future) are available for anomaly detection. While this setting is not real-time, but it typically offers more robust anomaly detection.

The idea makes sense although there seems to be not much detail in how to choose the surrogate distribution. There is a mechanism to study the threshold.

The proposed method is shown to offer improvements over alternatives on a set of real data problems and the minimax objective identified is well motivated, however, I am not entirely convinced that (a) the performance improvements arise for the hypothesised reasons, and (b) that the test setting is of wide applicability.

A fundamental distinction between parametric and non-parametric tests for CPD in timeseries data is that the adoption of parametric assumptions allows for an easier introduction of strict but meaningful relationships in the temporal structure---e.g. a first order autoregressive model introduces a simple Markov structure---whereas non-parametric kernel tests typically imagine samples to be iid (before and after the change-point).  For this reason, the non-parametric tests may lack robustness to certain realistic types of temporal distributional changes: e.g. in the parameter of an autoregressive timeseries.  On the other hand, it may be prohibitively difficult to design parametric models to well characterise high dimensional data, whereas non-parametric models can typically do well in high dimension when the available data volumes are large.  In the present application it seems that the setting imagined is for low dimensional data of limited size in which there is likely to be non-iid temporal structure (i.e., outside the easy relative advantage of non-parametric methods).  For this reason it seems to me the key advantage offered by the proposed approach with its use of a distributional autoregressive process for the surrogate model may well be to introduce robustness against Type 1 errors due to otherwise unrepresented temporal structure in the base distribution (P).  In summarising the performance results by AUC it is unclear whether it is indeed the desired improvement in test power that offers the advantages or whether it is in fact a decrease in Type 1 errors.

Another side of my concern here is that I disagree with the statement: "As no prior knowledge of Q ... intuitiviely, we have to make G as close to P as possible" interpretted as a way to maximise test power; as a way to minimise Type 1 errors, yes.

Across change-point detection methods it is also important to distinguish key aspects of the problem formulation.  One particular specification here is that we have already some labelled instances of data known to come from the P distribution, and perhaps also some fewer instances of data labelled from Q.  This is distinct from fully automated change point detection methods for time series such as automatic scene selection in video data.  Another dissimilarity to that archetypal scenario is that here we suppose the P and Q distributions may have subtle differences that we're interested in; and it would also seem that we assume there is only one change-point to detect.  Or at least the algorithm does not seem to be designed to be applied in a recursive sense as it would be for scene selection.

Finally there is no discussion here of computational complexity and cost?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJejUysX6m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>RE: Not convinced that improvements are from better power </a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1GbfhRqF7&amp;noteId=HJejUysX6m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1239 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">10 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1239 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thank you very much for your valuable comments. We would try to address your concerns as below.

We agree with you that there are multiple settings for change point detection (CPD) where samples could be piecewise iid, non-iid autoregressive, and more. It is truly difficult to come up with a generic framework to tackle all these different settings. In this paper, following the previous CPD works [1,2,3,4], we stay with the piecewise iid assumption of the time series samples. Extending the current model to other settings, such as the scene detection task, is interesting and we leave it for future work.

For the piecewise iid case, as shown in our toy experiment in Sec. 3, optimizing kernel using surrogate distribution G indeed leads to better test power when samples from Q are insufficient. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our kernel selection objective without any autoregressive/RNN modeling to control the Type-I error. In Table 3, It is even interesting to see that for the synthetic Jumping-Mean and Scaling-Variance datasets that are generated from an autoregressive model with non-iid temporal samples, the non-parametric methods (RDR-KCPD and Mstats-KCPD) without RNN modeling are also comparable, sometimes better, compared to the AR-based methods.

For the non-iid temporal structure in real-world applications, the concern is the improvement coming from adopting RNN and controlling type-I error for model selection (kernel selection). Indeed, using RNN parameterized kernels (trained by minimizing reconstruction loss) buy us some gain compared to directly conduct kernel two-sample test on the original time series samples (Fig 3 cyan bar rises to blue bar), but we still have to do model selection to decide the parameters of RNN.  In Table 2, we studied a kernel learning baseline, OPT-MMD, that optimizing an RNN parameterized kernel by controlling type-I error but without the surrogate distribution. OPT-MMD is inferior to the KL-CPD that introduce the surrogate distribution with an auxiliary generator. On the other hand, from Table 2, we can also observe KL-CPD is better than other RNN alternatives, such as LSTNet.  Those performance gaps between KL-CPD, OPT-MMD (regularizing type-I only) and other RNN works indicate the proposed maximizing testing power framework via an auxiliary distribution serves as a good surrogate for kernel (model) selection. 
 
In summary, we agree with you part of the improvement coming from introducing RNN,  and that our framework does have some limitation for different CPD settings. For the choice of real-world applications, we mainly follow the CPD literature [2,4], which also made piecewise iid assumptions on the time series samples while applying their framework on the likely non-iid real-world datasets, but we still observe the improvement brought by KL-CPD. It would be interesting to develop a theoretical framework for kernel learning to deal with non-iid data, and we leave it as future work.
