In this work we study the possibility of leveraging such repeated structure to speed up and regularize learning. We start from the KL regularized expected reward objective which introduces an additional component, a default policy. Instead of relying on a fixed default policy, we learn it from data. But crucially, we restrict the amount of information the default policy receives, forcing it to learn reusable behaviors that help the policy learn faster. We formalize this strategy and discuss connections to information bottleneck approaches and to the variational EM algorithm. We present empirical results in both discrete and continuous action domains and demonstrate that, for certain tasks, learning a default policy alongside the policy can significantly speed up and improve learning.
Please watch the video demonstrating learned experts and default policies on several continuous control tasks ( <a href="https://youtu.be/U2qA3llzus8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/U2qA3llzus8</a> ).</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Deep Reinforcement Learning, Continuous Control, RL as Inference</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Limiting state information for the default policy can improvement performance, in a KL-regularized RL framework where both agent and default policy are optimized together</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rygVCXQWR7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>thanks for the reviews; authors response?</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1lqMn05Ym&amp;noteId=rygVCXQWR7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1293 Area Chair1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">20 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1293 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thanks for the detailed review comments thus far.

Different from previous works, the policy and default policy are learned simultaneously.  Furthermore, it demonstrates that the default policy can be used to perform transfer learning.

Pros:

- Overall the paper is well-written and the organization is easy to follow.  The approach is novel and most relevant works are compared and contrasted.  The intuitions provided nicely complements the concepts and experiments are thorough.

Cons:

- The idea of separating policy and default policy seems similar to having high and low level controller (HLC and LLC) in hierarchical control -- where LLC takes proprioceptive observations as input, and HLC handles task specific goals.  In contrast, one advantage of the proposed method in this work is that the training is end-to-end.  Would have liked to see comparison between the proposed method and hierarchical control.

- As mentioned, the proposed method does not offer significant speed-up in dense-reward settings.  Considering that most of the tasks experimented in the paper can leverage dense shaping to achieve speed-up over sparse rewards, it'd be nice to have experiments to show that for some environments the proposed method can out-perform baseline methods even in dense-reward settings.

We know from cognitive science literature, that there are 2 distinct modes of decision making - habit based and top-down control (goal directed) decision making. The paper proposes to use this intuition by using information theoretic objective such that the agent follows "default" policy on average and agent gets penalized for changing its "default" behaviour, and the idea is to minimize this cost on average across states.

The paper is very well written. I think, this paper would have good impact in coming up with new learning algorithms which are inspired from cognitive science literature as well as mathematically grounded. But I dont think, paper in its current form is suitable for publication. 

There are several reasons, but most important:

1) Most of the experiments in this paper use of the order of  10^9 or even 10^10 steps. Its practically not possible for anyone in academia to have such a compute. Now, that said, I do think this paper is pretty interesting. Hence, Is it possible to construct a toy problem which has similar characteristics, and then show similar results using like 10^6 or 10^7 steps ? I think it would be easy to construct a 2D POMPD maze navigation env and test similar results. This would improve the paper, as well as could provide a baseline which people in the future can compare to.

2) It becomes more important to compare to stronger baselines like maximum entropy RL ( for ex. Soft Actor Critic). And spend some good of amount time getting these baselines right on these new environments. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Bye57sxdhQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Good work in general</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1lqMn05Ym&amp;noteId=Bye57sxdhQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1293 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1293 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">
-- Originality --

This paper studies how to use KL-regularization with information asymmetry to speed up and improve reinforcement learning (RL). Compared with existing work, the major novelty in the proposed algorithm is that it uses a default policy learned from data, rather than a fixed default policy. Moreover, the proposed algorithm also limits the amount of information the default policy receives, i.e., there is an "information asymmetry" between the agent policy and the default policy. In many applications, the default policy is purposely chosen to be "goal agnostic" and hence conducts the "transfer learning". To the best of my knowledge, this "informationally asymmetric" KL-regularization approach is novel.

-- Clarify --

The paper is well written in general and is easy to follow.

-- Significance --

I think the idea of regularizing RL via an informationally asymmetric default policy is interesting. It might be an efficient way to do transfer learning (generalization) in some RL applications. This paper has also done extensive and rigorous experiments. Some experiment results are thought-provoking.

-- Pros and Cons

Pros:

1)  The idea of regularizing RL via an informationally asymmetric default policy is interesting. To the best of my knowledge, this "informationally asymmetric" KL-regularization approach is novel.

2) The experiment results are extensive, rigorous, and thought-provoking.

Cons:

1) My understanding is that this "informationally asymmetric" KL-regularization approach is a general approach and can be combined with many policy learning algorithms. It is not completely clear to me why the authors choose to combine it with an actor-critic approach (see Algorithm 1)? Why not combine it with other policy learning algorithms? Please explain.

2) This paper does not have any theoretical results. I fully understand that it is highly non-trivial or even impossible to analyze the proposed algorithm in the general case. However, I recommend the authors to analyze (possibly a variant of) the proposed algorithm in a simplified setting (e.g. the network has only one layer, or even is linear) to further strengthen the results.

3) The experiment results of this paper are interesting, but I think the authors can do a better job of intuitively explaining the experiment results. For instance, the experiment results show that when the reward is "dense shaping", the proposed method and the baseline perform similarly. Might the authors provide an intuitive explanation for this observation? I recommend the authors to try to provide intuitive explanation for all such interesting observations in the paper.
