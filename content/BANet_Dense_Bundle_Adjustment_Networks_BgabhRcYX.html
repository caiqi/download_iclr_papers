The whole pipeline is differentiable so that the network can learn suitable feature representations that make the BA problem more tractable. Furthermore, this work introduces a novel depth parameterization to recover dense per-pixel depth. The network first generates some bases depth maps according to the input image and optimizes the final depth as a linear combination of these bases via feature BA. The bases depth map generator is also learned via end-to-end training. 
The whole system nicely combines domain knowledge (i.e. hard-coded multi-view geometry constraints) and machine learning (i.e. feature learning and basis depth map generator learning) to address the challenging SfM problem.

Specifically, a CNN computes both a multi-scale feature pyramid and a depth prediction, expressed as a linear combination of "depth bases".
These values are used to define a dense re-projection error over the images, akin to that of dense or semi-dense methods.
Then, this error is optimized with respect to the camera parameters and depth linear combination coefficients using Levenberg-Marquardt (LM).
By unrolling 5 iterations of LM and expressing the dampening parameter lambda as the output of a MLP, the optimization process is made differentiable, allowing back-propagation and thus learning of the networks' parameters.

The paper is clear, well organized, well written and easy to follow.
Even if the idea of joining BA / SfM and deep learning is not new, the authors propose an interesting novel formulation.
In particular, being able to train the CNN with a supervision signal coming directly from the same geometric optimization process that will be used at test time allows it to produce features that  will make the optimization smoother and the convergence easier.
The experiments are quite convincing and seem to clearly support the efficacy of the proposed method.

I don't really have any major criticism, but I would like to hear the authors' opinions on the following two points:

1) In page 5, the authors write "learns to predict a better damping factor lambda, which gaurantees that the optimziation will converged to a better solution within limited iterations".
I don't really understand how learning lambda would _guarantee_ that the optimization will converge to a better solution.
The word "guarantee" usually implies that the effect can be somehow mathematically proved, which is not done in the paper.

2) As far as I can understand, once the networks are learned, possibly on pairs of images due to GPU memory limitations, the proposed approach can be easily applied to sets of images of any size, as the features and depth predictions can be pre-computed and stored in main system memory.
Given this, I wonder why all experiments are conducted on sets of two to five images, even for Kitti where standard evaluation protocols would demand predicting entire sequences.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SylPHRPDnQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An interesting work but lacking some details concerning the implementation and experimentations</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1gabhRcYX&amp;noteId=SylPHRPDnQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1217 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1217 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">I believe that the authors have a solid contribution that can be interesting for the ICLR community.
Therefore, I recommend to accept the paper but after revision because the presentation and explanation of the ideas contain multiple typos and lacking some details (see bellow). 

Summary:
The authors propose a new method called BA-Net to solve the SfM problem by explicitly incorporating geometry priors into a machine learning task. The authors focus on the Bundle Adjustment process. 

Given several successive frames of a video sequence (2 frames but can be extended up to 5), BA-Net jointly estimates the depth of the first frame and the relative camera motion (between the first frame and the next one).
The method is based on a convolutional neural network which extracts the features of the different pyramid levels of the two images and in parallel computes the depth map of the first frame. The proposed network is based on the DRN-54 (Yu et al., 2017) as a feature extractor. 

This is complemented by the linear combination of depth bases obtained from the first image.
The features and the initial depth then passed to the optimization layer called BA-layer where the feature re-projection error is minimized by the modified LM algorithm. 

The authors adapt the standard multi-view geometry constraints by a new concept of feature re-projection error in the BA framework (BA-layer) which they made differentiable. 
Differentiable optimization of camera motion and image depth via LM algorithm is now possible and can be used in various other DL architectures (ex. MVS-Net can probably benefit from BA-layer).

The authors also propose a novel depth parametrization in the form of linear combination of depth bases which reduces the number of parameters for the learning task, 
enables integration into the same backbone net as used or feature pyramids and makes it possible to jointly train the depth generator and the BA-layer. 

Originally the proposed approach depicts the network operating in the two-view settings. The extensibility to more views is also possible and, as shown by authors, proved to improve performance. It is, however, limited by the GPU capacity. 

Overall, the authors came up with an interesting approach to the standard BA problem. They have managed to inject the multi-view geometry priors and BA into the DL architecture. 

Major comments regarding the paper:

It would be interesting to know the evaluation times for the BA-net and more importantly to have some implementation details to ensure reproducibility.

Minor comments regarding the paper:

-	The spacing between sections is not consistent. 
-	Figures 1 is way too abstract given the complicated set-up of the proposed architecture. It would be nice to see more details on the subnet for depth estimator and output of the net. 
Overall it would be helpful for reproducibility if authors can visualize all the layers of all the different parts of the network as it is commonly done in the DL papers.
-	Talking about proposed formulation of BA use either of the following and be consistent across the paper:
Featuremetric BA / Feature-metric BA / Featuremetric BA / ‘Feature-metric BA’
-	Talking about depth parametrization use ‘basis’ or ‘bases’ not both and clearly defined the meaning of this important notion.
-	Attention should be given to the notation in formulas (3) and (4). The projection function there is no longer accepts a 3D point parametrized by 3 variables. Instead only depth is provided. 
In addition, the subindex ‘1’ of the point ‘q’ is not explained. 
-	More attention should be given to the evaluation section. Specifically to the tables (1 and 2) with quantitative results showing the comparison to other methods. 
It is not clear how the depth error is measured and it would be nicer to have the other errors explained exactly as they referred in the tables (e.g. ATE?).
-	How the first camera pose is initialized?
-	In Figure 2.b I’m surprised by the difference obtained in the feature maps for images which seems very similar (only the lighting seems to be different). Is it three consecutive frames?
-	Attention should be given to the grammar, formatting in particular the bibliography.

The input is a set of images; the output is the camera poses and the depth maps for all the images.
The approach is inspired by Levenberg-Marquardt optimization (LM): A pipeline extracting image features computes the Jacobian of an error function. This Jacobian is used to update an estimate of the camera poses. As in LM optimization, this update is done based on a factor lambda, weighting a gradient descent step and a Gauss-Newton step. In LM optimization, this lambda evolves with the improvement of the estimate. Here lambda is also predicted using a network based on the feature difference.

If I understand correctly, what is learned is how to compute image features that provide good updates, how to predict the depth maps from the features, and how to predict lambda.

The method is compared against DeMoN and other baselines with good results.

I like the fact that the method is based on LM optimization, which is the standard method in 'geometric bundle adjustment', while related works consider Gauss-Newton-like optimization steps. The key was to include a network to predict lambda as well.

However, I have several concerns:

* the ablation study designed to compare with a Gauss-Newton-like approach does not seem correct. The image features learned with the proposed method are re-used in an approach using a fixed lambda. If I understand correctly, there are 2 things wrong with that:
- for GN optimization, lambda should be set to 0 - not a constant value. Several constant values should also have been tried.
- the image features should be re-trained for the GN framework:  Since the features are learned for the LM iteration, they are adapted to the use of the predicted lambda, but they are not necessarily suitable to GN optimization.
Thus, the advantage of using a LM optimization scheme is not very convincing.

Since the LM-like approach is the main contribution, and the reported experiments do not show an advantage over GN-like approaches (already taken by previous work), this is my main reason for proposing rejection.

* CodeSLAM (best paper at CVPR'18) is referenced but there is no comparison with it, while a comparison on the EuRoC dataset should be possible.

Less critical concerns that still should be taken into account if the paper is accepted:

- the state vector Chi is not defined for the proposed method, only for the standard bundle adjustment approach. If I understand correctly is made of the camera poses.

- the name 'Bundle Adjustment' is actually not adapted to the proposed method.  'Bundle Adjustment' in 'geometric computer vision' comes from the optimization of several rays to intersect at the same 3D point, which is done by minimizing the reprojection errors. Here the objective function is based on image feature differences. I thus find the name misleading. The end of Section 3 also encourages the reader to think that the proposed method is based on the reprojection error. The proposed method is more about dense alignment for multiple images.
