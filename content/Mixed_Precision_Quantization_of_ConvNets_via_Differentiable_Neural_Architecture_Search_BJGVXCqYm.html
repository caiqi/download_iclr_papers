However, existing quantization methods often represent all weights and activations with the same precision (bit-width). In this paper, we explore a new dimension of the design space: quantizing different layers with different bit-widths. We formulate this problem as a neural architecture search problem and propose a novel differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) framework to efficiently explore its exponential search space with gradient-based optimization. Experiments show we surpass the state-of-the-art compression of ResNet on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Our quantized models with 21.1x smaller model size or 103.9x lower computational cost can still outperform baseline quantized or even full precision models.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Neural Net Quantization, Neural Architecture Search</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">A novel differentiable neural architecture search framework for mixed quantization of ConvNets.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">5 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1guYU4w67" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Contribution not significant; Potentially covered by prior work</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJGVX3CqYm&amp;noteId=H1guYU4w67"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1349 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">13 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1349 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper approaches the bit quantization problem from the perspective of neural architecture search, by treating each possible precision as a different type of neural layer. They estimate the proportion of each layer using a gumbel-softmax reparametrization. Training updates parameters and these proportions alternately. 

The authors claim that prior work has only dealt with uniform bit precision. This is clearly false e.g. 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00942.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00942.pdf</a>
https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04788
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08665.pdf

In particular, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00942.pdf uses the same approach, using gumbel-softmax to estimate the best number of bits. In the least, the authors needs to mention and contrast their approach, e.g. they can handle a budget constraint, but they use a fixed quantization function.

There is an inherent strength in this approach that the authors have not fully explored. The most recent key discovery in low precision networks is that the optimal parameters take very different values depending on the precision, ie beyond simple clipping/snapping based on quantization error. The DNAS approach can capture this, because the parameters of different precisions need not be constrained via a fixed quantization/activation function (appendix B). Therefore the following questions become important to understand.

1. How are the weights w updated for low precision. I understand that you first sample an architecture but there is no explanation of how the low bit (e.g. 1-bit) weights are updated. Do you update the 32-bit weights, then use the functions in Appendix B to derive the low bit parameters? This is much less interesting than the power of the DNAS idea. Do you directly update them using STE?
2. Why is it important to train in an alternating fashion? How did you split the training set in to two for each ? Why not use a single training set?
3. Are the "edge probabilities" over different precision in any way the function of the input (image)? It seems your approach is able to distinguish "easy" and "hard" images by increasing the precision of parameters. If so, this should be explained and demonstrated. 
4. In Eq (10), it is unusual to take the product of network performance and penalty term for parsimony. This needs to be explained vs. taking a sum of the two terms which has the nice interpretation of being the lagrangian of a constrained optimization problem. Do you treat these as instance level weights? 
5. Experiments only show ResNet architecture, whereas prior work showed a broaded set of results. Only TTQ and ADMM is compared, where the most relevant work is https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00942.pdf. It is not clear if the good performance comes due to the block connectivity structure with skip connections, combined with the fact that the first and last layers are not quantized. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: Clear rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SygQwnxPaX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Inetresting approach to quantization and interesting experimental results</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJGVX3CqYm&amp;noteId=SygQwnxPaX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1349 AnonReviewer4</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">12 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1349 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors propose a network quantization approach with adaptive per layer bit-width. The approach is based on a network architecture search (NAS) method. The authors aim to solve the NAS problem through SGD. Therefore, they propose to first reprametrize the the discrete random variable determining if an edge is computed or not to make it differentiable and then use Gumbel Softmax function as a way to effectively control the variance of the obtained unbiased estimator. This variance can indeed make the convergence of the procedure hard. The procedure is then adapted to the problem of network quantization with different band-widths.

The proposed approach is interesting. The differerentiable NAS procedure is particularly important and can have an important impact. The idea of having an adaptive per layer precision is also well motivated, and shows competitive (if not better) results empirically. 

Some additional experiments can make the paper stronger:
* Compare the result of the procedure to an exhaustive search in a setting where the latter is feasible (shallow architecture on an easy task with few possible bit widths)
* Compare the procedure to other state of the art NAS procedures (DARTS and ENAS) with the same search space adapted to the quantization problem, to empirically show that the proposed procedure is a compromise between these two methods as claimed by the authors. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1gK_Y3J6Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Neural Architecture Search Approach to Network Quantization</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJGVX3CqYm&amp;noteId=H1gK_Y3J6Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1349 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">07 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1349 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">In this work the authors introduce a new method for neural architecture search (NAS) and use it in the context of network compression. Specifically, the NAS method is used to select the precision quantization of the weights at each layer of the neural network. Briefly, this is done by first defining a super network, which is a DAG where for each pair of nodes, the output node is the linear combination of the outputs of all possible operations (i.e., layers with different precision quantizations). Following [1], the weights of the linear combination are regarded as the probabilities of having certain operations (i.e., precision quantization), which allows for learning a probability distribution over the considered operations. Differently from [1], however, the authors bridge the soft sampling in [1] (where all operations are considered together but weighted accordingly to the corresponding probabilities) to a hard sampling (where a single operation is considered with the corresponding probability) through an annealing procedure based on the Gumbel Softmax technique. Through the proposed NAS algorithm, one can learn a probability distribution on the operations by minimizing a loss that accounts for both accuracy and model size. The final output of this search phase is a set of sampled architectures (containing a single operation at each connection between nodes), which are then retrained from scratch. In applications to CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, the authors achieve (and sometime surpass) state-of-the-art performance in model compression.

The two contributions of this work are
1)	A new approach to weight quantization using principles of NAS that is novel and promising;
2)	New insights/technical improvements in the broader field of NAS. While the utility of the method in the more general context of NAS has not been shown, this work will likely be of interest to the NAS community.

I only have one major concern. The architectures are sampled from the learnt probability distribution every certain number of epochs while training the supernet. Why? If we are learning the distribution, would not it make sense to sample all architectures only after training the supernet at our best?
This reasoning leads me to a second question. In the CIFAR-10 experiments, the authors sample 5 architecture every 10 epochs, which means 45 architectures (90 epochs were considered). This is a lot of architectures, which makes me wonder: how would a “cost-aware” random sampling perform with the same number of sampled architectures?

Also, I have some more questions/minor concerns:

1)	The authors say that the expectation of the loss function is not directly differentiable with respect to the architecture parameters because of the discrete random variable. For this reason, they introduce a Gumbel Softmax technique, which makes the mask soft, and thus the loss becomes differentiable with respect to the architecture parameters. However, subsequently in the manuscript, they write that Eq 6 provides an unbiased estimate for the gradients. Do they here refer to the gradients with respect to the weights ONLY? Could we say that the advantage of the Gumbel Softmax technique is two-fold? i) make the loss differentiable with respect to the arch parameters; ii) reduce the variance of the estimate of the loss gradients with respect to the network weights.

2)	Can the author discuss why the soft sampling procedure in [1] is not enough? I have an intuitive understanding of this, but I think this should be clearly discussed in the manuscript as this is a central aspect of the paper.

3)	The authors use a certain number of warmup steps to train the network weights without updating the architecture parameters to ensure that “the weights are sufficiently trained”. Can the authors discuss the choice on the number of warmup epochs?

I gave this paper a 5, but I am overall supportive. Happy to change my score if the authors can address my major concern.

The key insights of this paper is quantizing different layers with different bit-widths, instead of using fixed 32-bit width for all layer weights and activation in previous works. At the same time, this paper adopted the idea form both DARTS and ENAS with parameter sharing, and introduces a new differentiable neural architecture search framework. As the authors proposed, this DNAS framework is able to search efficiently and effective through a large search space.  As demonstrated in the Experiment section of the paper, it achieves better validation accuracy than ResNet with much smaller model size and lower computational cost.

1. An improved gradient method in updating the network architecture and parameters compared to DARTS and ENAS. It applies the Gumbel softmax to refine the sub-graph structure without training the entire super-net through the whole process. The work is able to obtain the same level of validation accuracy on Cifar-10 as ResNet while reduce the model parameters by a large margin. 
2. The work is in the middle ground of two previous works: ENAS by Pham et al. (2018) and DARTS by Liu et al. (2018). However, there is no comparison with ENAS and DARTS in experiments. ENAS samples child networks from the super net to be trained independently while DARTS trains the entire super net together without decoupling child networks from the super net. By using Gumbel Softmax with an annealing temperature, The proposed DNAS pipeline behaves more like DARTS at the beginning of the search and behaves more like ENAS at the end.

Your summary correctly and comprehensively reflects the gist of our paper. One minor correction we would like to make is that our experiments are not only conducted on the Cifar-10 dataset. On ImageNet dataset, we were able to compress ResNet models with no or little accuracy loss, but reduce the model size by up to 21.1x and computational cost by up to 103.5x, better than previous baselines.
