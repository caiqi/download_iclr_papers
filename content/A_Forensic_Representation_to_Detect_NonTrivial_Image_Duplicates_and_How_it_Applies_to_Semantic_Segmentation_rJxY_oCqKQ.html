Existing tools for detecting image duplication are mostly manual or semi-automated, despite the fact that generating data for a learning-based approach is straightforward, as we here illustrate. This paper addresses the problem of determining if, given two images, one is a manipulated version of the other by means of certain geometric and statistical manipulations, e.g. copy, rotation, translation, scale, perspective transform, histogram adjustment, partial erasing, and compression artifacts. We propose a solution based on a 3-branch Siamese Convolutional Neural Network. The ConvNet model is trained to map images into a 128-dimensional space, where the Euclidean distance between duplicate (respectively, unique) images is no greater (respectively, greater) than 1. Our results suggest that such an approach can serve as tool to improve surveillance of the published and in-peer-review literature for image manipulation. We also show that as a byproduct the network learns useful representations for semantic segmentation, with performance comparable to that of domain-specific models.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">metric learning, image similarity, image forensics, siamese network, semantic segmentation</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">A forensic metric to determine if a given image is a copy (with possible manipulation) of another image from a given dataset.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1g6kYsbCQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Submission Withdrawn by the Authors</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxY_oCqKQ&amp;noteId=B1g6kYsbCQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper376 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">20 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper376 Withdraw Submission</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Withdrawal confirmation: </span><span class="note_content_value">I have read and agree with the withdrawal statement on behalf of myself and my co-authors.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BygWKTypnm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting engineering work, but rather limited novelties</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxY_oCqKQ&amp;noteId=BygWKTypnm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper376 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper376 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This manuscript introduces a method, called siamese network (SN), to identify duplicate and copied/modified images, which can be used to improve surveillance of the published and in-peer-review literature. The topic is interesting and the authors showcased that their method can be used for a side application of semantic segmentation as well. 
The paper is a very interesting engineering article. But its novelties and merits seem limited and rather incremental. There are several unclear points in the method, and more importantly it is not clear where the method stands among the various previous works. There are no proper comparison with previous works nor enough ablation studies to support the claims provided in the paper.
-	There are three parallel streams of CNN in the proposed 3-branch network. Are they sharing parameters? If No, why not! It seems like they need to be learning similar set of features sharing parameters is the most feasible approach. There are no discussions on this, nor any analyses in the experiments. Whereas for the previous work on the same topic (Chopra et al. (2005)) has a two-branch network that shares parameters.  
-	The results suggest that SN may not be good enough to be used as a fully autonomous forensic detector, but it can narrow down the pool of images which can be subjected to further human review or interventions. The question here will be how different this method is compared to all previous similar research (some of which introduced in Section 2). There are absolutely no comparisons with any previous/other methods (neither theoretically nor experimentally). Why do we need another method that does almost the same as previous works? If it is better than the previous ones, this should come out from the paper. 
-	The results section is very brief and does not include proper comparisons. Even for the semantic segmentation, the authors only compared with U-Net, and their results are just comparable with it, not any better. U-Net now is not even close to the state-of-the-art for semantic segmentation, especially for the datasets used in the paper (for cell and nuclei segmentation). 
-	One of the main issues with this line of research is that the dataset is not public and, probably due to legal issues, it may not become public. Therefore, future comparisons and reproducibility of the research may be of concern.

of duplicate image detection.

It is a pure application paper and the triplet loss very well known in the
community for retrieval and ranking.
The generation of the near-duplicate images using random transformations is
also quite standard. However, given the application domain the authors should
explain why some parameters have been chosen rather than others. I assume the
level of variability here is not that large and the space can be constrained.

The parameter alpha in the triplet loss could be omitted as it can be
"absorbed" by the network. Also why didn't the author comment on their choice
of such loss? The original one has a margin for example.

I am afraid that the paper lacks the necessary rigor in the experimental
section. There are no baselines and comparisons to other losses such as the
siamese loss, that would seem easier and more appropriate for this task given
the binary outcome.

I have to admit that I don't quite understand the motivation of the work,
to me it seems that standard techniques would be already quite successful here.
For example classic feature matching with SIFT, to which I encourage the authors
to compare to.

To summarize I think the paper still requires lot of work before being considered
for publication.

The authors propose standard CNN and loss functions and apply it to this field. The evaluation is performed on an in-house dataset and synthetic data.

Novelty:
There are no significant new contributions other than the application to this very narrow field. The experimental results don't appear to be very conclusive wrt the usability of this proposed approach.

Clarity:
The paper is written well and mostly clear. Eq 1 does not explain what the sum over k is about. Eq 2/3 seems to have a typo and should be f^01, f^02.

Experiments:
It is not clear what the classes in Sec 4 refer to, and more specifically what the distinction between classes and categories is. It seems that categories are different types of images whereas classes are different transformations of images in the same category. If this is the case it doesn't seem very instructive to compare the accuracy across categories.

Fig3 a/b shows a scatter plot, I believe that a ROC curve would be much more instructive here.

It is not clear what exactly was compared when comparing with U-Net. The authors mention that their models train faster and don't require labelled data, but some more details of what exactly was compared would be helpful. E.g. what exactly was pre-trained and fine-tuned.

Overall this work does not seem suitable for ICLR due to the narrow application, lack of positive results and no scientific contributions beyond what's already widely used in the vision community.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">2: Strong rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
