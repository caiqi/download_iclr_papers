Summary

From a theoretical point of view, one might be tempted to believe that deep CNNs are translation equivariant and their predictions are translation invariant. In practice, this is not necessarily true. The authors propose to augment standard deep CNNs with low-pass filters to reduce this problem. The results seem promising for an older VGG architecture.

Quality

The paper is very verbose, the figures and captions are tedious to read, the mathematical notation seems strange as well, making the writing more concise is highly encouraged. The main ideas are easy to follow and the choice of experiments seems fine. 

Significance

This is the first empirical work trying to fix the issue of non-translation equivariance in convolutional neural networks. The conclusions of this work are potentially relevant for a wide audience of CNN practitioners.

Main Concerns

To show that all claims of the paper do indeed hold, the authors should attack their augmented network with the translation attack of [1]. As robustness to this type of transformations is one of the main goals, it should be tested if it was achieved. The attack can be found in some open source frameworks [2] and should be easy to apply.

Wall-clock times need to be reported for the various blurring kernels and compared to the baselines.

Extend results to a cutting-edge architecture, e.g. DenseNets or Wide ResNets. If this result is not provided the significance of the work is not clear.

Despite being more expensive, do dilations fix the issue of missing translation equivariance provably and not just approximately like the low-pass filtering approach proposed here? This should be discussed and a comparison in terms of wall-clock time would be great as well.

Minor

- Strange notation e.g. in equation 1. Why not write: x+\delta x in the argument of the function instead of "Shift". The current notation seems unnecessarily informal.
- Figure 4: show scale and color bar.

And based on that the paper proposed the modified pooling operation by introducing a low-pass filter which endows a shift-equivariance in the convolution features and consequently the shift-invariance of CNNs.

Pros:
1.	The paper proposed a simple but novel approach to make CNNs shift-invariant following the traditional signal processing principle.
2.	This work gave convincing analysis (from both theoretical illustrations and experimental visualizations) on the problem of original pooling and the effectiveness of the proposed blur kernels.
3.	The experiment gave some promising results. Without augmentation, the proposed method shows higher consistency to the random shifts.

Cons:
1.	When cooperating with augmentation, the test accuracy on random shifted images of proposed method did not exceed the baseline. Although the consistency is higher, it is secondary to the test accuracy of random shifted data. And it is confused to do average on consistency and test accuracy, which are in different scales, and then compare the overall performance on the averages. 
2.	It seems to be more convincing if the ‘random’ test accuracy is acquired by averaging several random shifts on a single image and then do average among images, as well as to show how accuracy various on shifting distance.
3.	Some other spatial transforming/shifting adaptive approaches should be taken into consideration to compare the performance.
4.	There are some minor typos, such as line 3 in Section 3.1 and line 15 in Section 3.2

In general this work presents a simple and easy to implement solution to a common problem of CNNs and even though it lacks more thorough theoretical analysis of this problem from the signal processing perspective (such as minimal size of the blurring kernel for fulfilling the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem), it seems to provide ample empirical evidence.

Pros:
+ The introduction and motivation is really well written and Figure 3 provides a clear visualisation main max pooling operator issues.
+ The proposed method is really simple and shows promising results on the CIFAR dataset. With random shifts, authors had to tackle cropping with circular shifts. As it can cause artifacts in the data, authors also provide baseline performances on the original data (used for both training and testing).
+ Authors provide a thorough evaluation, ranging from comparing hidden representations to defining consistency metrics of the classified classes.

This work is lacking in the experimental section due to some missing details and few inconsistencies. I believe the most of my concerns can be relatively easily fixed/clarified in an update of this submission.

Major issues, which if fixed would improve the rating:
- It is not correct to average test accuracy and test consistency as both measures are different quantities, especially when using them for ranking. The difference between accuracy of different methods are considerably smaller than differences in the classification consistency. 
- It is not clear how many shifts are used for computing the "Random Test Accuracy" and the "Classification Accuracy". Also whether the random shifts are kept constant between evaluated networks and evaluation metrics.
- Authors do not address the question what is the correct order of operations for the blurring. E.g. would the method empirically work if blurring was applied before max pooling? Do the operations commute?
- The selection of the filters is rather arbitrary, especially regarding the 1D FIR filters. The separability of these filters should be discussed.
- I believe authors should address how this work differs to [1], as it also tests different windowing functions for pooling operators, even though in different tasks.

Minor issues, which would be nice to fix however which do not influence my rating:
* Section 3.1 - And L-Layer deep *CNN*, H_l x W x C_l -&gt; H_l x W_l x C_l
* Section 3.1. Last paragraph - I would not agree with the statement that in CNNs the shift invariance must necessarily emerge upon shift equivariance. If anything, this may hold only for the last layer of a network without fully connected layers and with average pooling of the classifier output (ResNet/GoogleNet like networks).
* Explicitly provide the network architecture as [Simonyan14] does not test on CIFAR and cannot use Batch normalisation.
* It would be useful to add citation for the selected FIR filters.
* The flow of section 4.2. can be improved to help readability. The three metrics should be first motivated before their introduction. Metric 2. paragraph - the metric is defined below, not above. 
* It would be interesting to see what would be the performance if the blurring filters were trained as well (given some sensible initialisation).
* One future direction would be to verify that this approach generalises to larger networks as well. It might be worth to discuss this in the conclusions.

I was wondering if the authors could prepare an implementation of the proposed BlurDownsample layer into one of the existing frameworks, e.g. Tensorflow.  

One Question:
In Table 1, you evaluated 18 different filters and report that the Filter = [1,2,3,2,1] and the Filter = [1,6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1] outcome the best results. So, it seems to me that you had a search on the different combinations for the Blurring filter to find a filter that gives you the best Test accuracy. So, is this the right technique or you should find the best filter through the cross-validation on training dataset? 
And more importantly,  what if I use a convolutional layer which keep the dimensions of the input data same, and let the model finds the best filter through backpropagation, instead of using your Blurring layer with a fixed filter map? I mean, it seems to me your proposed layer is just a specific type of a convolutional layer, with a fixed filter map.

Some minor comments:
* "An L-layer deep can be..." --&gt; "An -L-layers deep neural network can be.."
* "Modern convolutional networks are not shift-invariant...".  This is not a proper beginning for the abstract.  First, what do you mean by "Modern"?. Second, they are actually partially shift-invariant (Modulo-N as you shown in figure 2), and not fully shift-invariant.
* This paper deserves a more relevant title. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
