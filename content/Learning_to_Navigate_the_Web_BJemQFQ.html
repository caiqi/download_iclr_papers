rewards can hinder the ability of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to learn
through trial-and-error. For instance, the problem of following natural language
instructions on theWeb (such as booking a flight ticket) leads to RL settings where
input vocabulary and number of actionable elements on a page can grow very
large. Even though recent approaches improve the success rate on relatively simpler
environments with the help of human demonstrations to guide the exploration,
they still fail in environments where the set of possible instructions can reach millions.
We approach the aforementioned problems from a different perspective and
propose a meta-trainer that can generate unbounded amount of experience for an
agent to learn from. Instead of learning from a complicated instruction with a
large vocabulary, we decompose it into multiple sub-instructions and schedule a
curriculum in which an agent is tasked with gradually increasing subset of these
relatively easier sub-instructions. We train DQN, deep reinforcement learning
agent, with Q-value function approximated with a novel QWeb neural network
architecture on these smaller, synthetic instructions. We evaluate the ability of
our agent to generalize to new instructions on World of Bits benchmark, on forms
with 100 elements, supporting 14 million possible instructions. The QWeb agent
outperforms the baseline without using any human demonstration achieving 100%
success rate on several difficult environments.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">navigating web pages, reinforcement learning, q learning, curriculum learning, meta training</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We train reinforcement learning policies using reward augmentation, curriculum learning, and meta-learning  to successfully navigate web pages.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_ryejZrK9h7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>a good RL application paper for dealing with large action and state spaces</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJemQ209FQ&amp;noteId=ryejZrK9h7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1342 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1342 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper developed a curriculum learning method for training an RL agent to navigate a web.

Here are the comments for improving this manuscript:
  
There are a few notations used without definition, for example DOM tree, Potential (in equation (4))

Some justification regarding the the Q value function specified in (1) might be helpful, otherwise it looks very adhoc.

Although using both shallow encoding and augmented reward lead to good empirical results, it might be useful to give more insights, for example, sample size limit cause overfitting for deep models?

What are the sizes of action state and action spaces?

The conclusion part is missing.

Summary:

The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning approach to filling out web forms, called QWeb.  In addition to both deep and shallow embeddings of the states, the authors evaluate various methods for improving the learning system, including reward shaping, introducing subgoals, and even a meta-learning algorithm that is used as an instructor.  These variations are tested in several environments and basic QWeb is shown to outperform the baselines and many of the adaptations perform even better than that in more complex domains.

Review:

Overall, the problem the paper considers is important and their results seem significant.  The authors have derived a novel architecture and are the first to tackle the problem of filling in web forms at this scale with an autonomous learning agent rather than one that is taught mostly by demonstration.  

The related work section is very well written with topical references to recent results and solid differentiations to the new algorithm.  However, I see many references in the paper are not from peer reviewed conferences or journals.  Unless absolutely necessary, such papers should not be cited because they have not been properly peer reviewed.  If the papers cited have actually been in a conference or journal, please add the correct attribution.

The experiments seem well conducted.  I liked that each new addition to the algorithm was tested incrementally in Figure 7 to give a realistic view of the gains introduced by each change.  I also thought the earlier comparisons to the baselines were well done and I liked that they were done against modern cutting-edge LfD demonstrations.  The only thing I would have liked to seen beyond these results are actual learning curves showing, after X iterations, what percentage of the tasks could be completed.  I suspect that in many domains the baseline LfD techniques are learning much faster since learning from teachers tends to be more targeted and sample efficient.  Learning curves would show us whether or not this is the case. 

The weakest part of the paper was the description of the instructor network and the Meta-training in general.  This portion seemed ill-described and largely speculative, despite the promising results in Figure 7.  In particular, Section 5 is very unclear on how exactly the Meta-Learning works.  Pseudocode is definitely needed in this portion well beyond the quick descriptions in Figure 4 and 5, which I could not understand, despite multiple readings.  I suggest eliminating those figures and providing concrete pseudo—code describing the meta learning and also addressing the following open questions in the text:
•	Why is a rule based randomized policy good to learn from?  How is this different from learning from demonstration in the baselines?
•	How is a “fine grained signal” generated?  What does that mean?  Is it a reward?
•	In Section 5.1, are there two RL agents, an instructor and a learner with different reward functions?  If so, isn’t this becoming game theoretic and is this likely to converge in most scenarios?
•	What does Q_D^I actually represent?  Why is maximizing these values a good thing?

There are a few grammatical mistakes in the paper including:

Abstract – simpler environments -&gt; simple environments
Abstract- with gradually increasing -&gt; with a gradually increasing
Page 2 – generate unbounded -&gt; generate an unbounded
Page 7 – correct value -&gt; correct values
Page 9 – episode length -&gt; episode lengths

spaces with sparse rewards in reinforcement learning. In particular,
they propose to use a meta-learner to generate experience to the agent
and to decompose the learning task into simpler sub-tasks. The authors
train a DQN with a novel architecture to navigate the Web.
In addition the authors propose to use several strategies: shallow
encoding (SE), reward shaping (AR) and curriculum learning (CI/CG). 
It is shown how the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
systems on several tasks.

In the first set of experiments it is clear the improved performance
of QWeb over Shi17 and Liu18, however, it is not clear why QWeb is not
able to learn in the social-media-all problem. The authors tested only
one of the possible variants (AR) of the proposed approach with good
performance. 

It is not clear in the book-flight-form environment, why the
QWeb+SE+AR obtained 100% success while the MetaQWeb, which includes
one of main components in this paper, has a lower performance.

The proposed method uses a large number of components/methods, but it
is not clear the relevance of each of them. The papers reads like, "I
have a very complex problem to solve so I try all the methods that I
think will be useful". The paper will benefit from an individual
assessment of the different components.

The authors should include a section of conclusions and future work.
