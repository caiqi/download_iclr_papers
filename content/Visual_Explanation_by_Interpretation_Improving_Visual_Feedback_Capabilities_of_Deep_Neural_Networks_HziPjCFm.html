In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for both interpretation as well as explanation in which, given a pretrained model, we automatically identify internal features relevant for the set of classes considered by the model, without relying on additional annotations. We interpret the model through average visualizations of this reduced set of features. Then, at test time, we explain the network prediction by accompanying the predicted class label with supporting visualizations derived from the identified features. In addition, we propose a method to address the artifacts introduced by strided operations in deconvNet-based visualizations. Moreover, we introduce an8Flower , a dataset specifically designed for objective quantitative evaluation of methods for visual explanation. Experiments on the MNIST , ILSVRC 12, Fashion 144k and an8Flower datasets show that our method produces detailed explanations with good coverage of relevant features of the classes of interest.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">model explanation, model interpretation, explainable ai, evaluation</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Interpretation by Identifying model-learned features that serve as indicators for the task of interest.

This paper
 - Proposes a method for producing visual explanations for deep neural network outputs,
 - Improves quality of the guided backprop approach for strided layers by converting stride 2 layers to stride 1 and resampling inputs (improving on a longstanding difficulty with such approaches),
 - Shows fairly rigorous experimentation demonstrating the applicability and properties of the proposed approach, and
 - Releases a new synthetic dataset and benchmark for visual explanation methods.

Although producing visual explanations is a task fraught with difficulty for many reasons, including that explanations for complex decisions may not necessarily be communicable via one or a small number of saliency maps over the image pixels, this paper strives valiantly in this admittedly difficult direction.

The experimentation is fairly rigorous, which is a welcome departure from and improvement on the norm for this type of paper. I hope such more quantitative evaluation will become more common in papers evaluating visual explanations.

Cons:

What about features that are very important but not linearly predictive on their own? This approach (and many others) would not work in that case; recognizing this, extending the an8Flower dataset to include such images and labels may be motivating for the field. For example, flowers where the class is determined not by a specific single color or feature (thorns or spots) but by the combination. In these cases, it’s not clear what the right answer would even be in the form of a saliency map, so the first task for researchers would be to determine in what format the answer should even be provided! So: less a benchmark than a motivating open question.


Smaller notes:

I found the presentation of the stride 1 resampling approach a little confusing. When performing the backward pass through the network from, say, layer 20, is the approach followed at every stride 2 layer on the way back? If so, I don’t think I saw this mentioned. If not, wouldn’t artifacts be introduced and compounded at any stride 2 layer during the backward pass?

Firstly, the authors produce a 1-dimensional descriptor for each filter in each convolutional layer for each image. Then these descriptors are concatenated as a new feature vector for this image. A feature selection algorithm (u-Lasso) is then trained to minimize the classification loss between the prediction from the new feature vector and the original prediction from DNN (formula (1)). Finally, the importance of each filter is identified by the weights of the lasso for each category.

The authors also improved the visual feedback quality over the deconvolution+guided back-propagation methods, and release a new synthetic dataset for benchmarking model explanation.

The paper is well-written, however, I have several concerns about this paper:

1.      How to verify the importance of the identified relevant features is a problem. In the experiments, the authors removed features in the network by setting their corresponding layer/filter to zero. The authors only compared their method with randomly removing features. And in Fig 4, the differences seem small for ImageNet. The results are not convincing enough to me. It is a bit baffling randomly removing features did almost as well as the proposed approach.

2.      I don't think one should get away with only showing some results from the synthetic dataset without showing any quantitative results on any real datasets. I like the idea of having a synthetic dataset where all the parameters are controllable. However in this case it is very simple and maybe lacking enough distracting features that can really test the capability of the algorithm. I would believe quantitative results on a realistic dataset are still necessary for the pubilcation of this paper.

3.      Recently several papers pointed out some significant issues in Guided BP, 

Xie et al. A Theoretical Explanation for Perplexing Behaviors of Backpropagation-based Visualizations. ICML 2018
Adebayo et al. Sanity Checks for Saliency Maps. NIPS 2018
Kindermans et al. The (Un)reliability of saliency methods. NIPS workshop 2017

can the authors comment on that? Based on those papers I don't seem to think Guided BP is actually doing anything that is relevant to the classification, but is just finding prominent gradients. This, unfortunately would lead to reasonably good behavior on the synthetic dataset created by the authors. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJgSnw53nQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A good paper with interesting contributions that requires improved motivations and some clarifications</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1ziPjC5Fm&amp;noteId=HJgSnw53nQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper294 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper294 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary: the paper proposes a method for Deep Neural Networks (DNN) that identifies automatically relevant features of the set of the classes, enriching the predictions made with the visual features that contributed to that class, supporting, thus, interpretation (understanding what the model has learned) and explanation (justification of the predictions/classifications made by the model). This scheme does not rely on additional annotations, like earlier techniques do.

The contributions of this paper are relevant to, I would say, a large segment of the AI community, since interpretability and explainability of AI (XAI) is the focus of many current works in the area, and there are still many unresolved issues. I consider this paper suitable for ICLR 2019, in particular, it fits the call for papers topic “visualization or interpretation of learned representations”.

The authors also present a new dataset (am8Flower) that can be used by the community for future evaluations of explanation methods for DNN. From my point of view, this is a significant contribution, since there is a lack of datasets that can be used for evaluation.

The authors motivate properly the need for this research/study, addressing the main weakness of the two more common strategies for interpreting DNN, (1) manually inspecting visualizations of every single filter or (2) comparing the internal activations produced by a given model w.r.t. a dataset with pixel-wise annotations of possibly relevant concepts.

I would encourage the authors to write the limitations and weakness of their proposal w.r.t. similar approaches they reviewed. I am aware that the space is limited, but in p.8, section 4.3, when Table 1 is introduced and the authors confirm that their proposal has higher IoU than other methods, the authors could explain, in brief, what are the weaknesses of their method w.r.t. the other approaches analyzed.

Another clarification concerns the initialization of input parameters, such as sparsity; e.g., p.6 sparsity is initialized with 10 for all datasets, why? How has this value been selected and how sensitive is the performance regarding variations of this value?

Once again, I know that the space is limited, but I would like to be able to see some of the figures better (since this is an essential part of the paper). The additional material complements very well the paper and shows larger figures, but I think that the paper itself should be self-sufficient, and figures like Fig. 5 should be enlarged so it is easier to see some details.

Just a concern or something that I quite did not understand about one of the arguments the authors use to justify the evaluation carried out: the authors claim that they want to avoid the subjectivity introduced by humans (citing Gonzalez-Garcia et al. 2017), and prefer to avoid user studies, presenting a more objective approach in their evaluation. Ok, but then, the analysis presented in, for example, page 7, is based mainly in their interpretation of the results, a qualitative analysis of the images (we can see fur patterns, this and that, etc.). So aren’t they interpreting the results obtained as users? So after all, aren’t the visual explanations and feedback intended for users? Why should we claim that we want to avoid the subjectivity introduced by humans in the evaluation when the method proposed here is actually going to be used by users –with their inherent subjectivity? I do not mean that the evaluation carried out is not interesting per se, but it could be motivated differently, or it could be complemented later on with future user studies (that would make an interesting addition to the paper). Moreover, I also wonder whom the authors see as intended users for the proposed scheme.
