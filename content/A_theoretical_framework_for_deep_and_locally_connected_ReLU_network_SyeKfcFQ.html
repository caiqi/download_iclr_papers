In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical framework for such networks with ReLU nonlinearity. The framework bridges data distribution with gradient descent rules, favors disentangled representations and is compatible with common regularization techniques such as Batch Norm, after a novel discovery of its projection nature. The framework is built upon teacher-student setting, by projecting the student's forward/backward pass onto the teacher's computational graph. We do not impose unrealistic assumptions (e.g., Gaussian inputs, independence of activation, etc). Our framework could help facilitate theoretical analysis of many practical issues, e.g. disentangled representations in deep networks. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">theoretical analysis, deep network, optimization, disentangled representation</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper presents a theoretical framework that models data distribution explicitly for deep and locally connected ReLU network</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">8 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rkgcPMmZAm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Revision (v2)</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyeKf30cFQ&amp;noteId=rkgcPMmZAm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1284 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">20 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1284 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">We have updated the main text of our paper to make the writing more clear.

1. Our teacher-student setting is introduced with more explanation and examples (e.g., a conceptual comparison between our modeling and top-down generative model). 

2. We have added more related works. 

3. The assumptions in Theorem 2 are explained, showing they are mild assumptions. 

4. The relationship between input data distribution P(x) and the conditional distribution of P(z_\beta|z_\alpha) is explained. 
 
5. We put a table (Tbl. 2) explaining all notations used in Sec. 5.2. 

6. A better explanation of how backpropagation of BatchNorm was regarded as a projection and how it is compatible with our framework. S(f) now is defined.

We acknowledge that there is confusion in terms of paper organization and math notations. We are working on a revision, which will be uploaded by Nov. 23. 

For now we first address the main questions raised by the reviewers. 

1. [R2] There is no main theorem in this paper. 

It remains a grand challenge for the whole community to come up with a theorem that relates data distribution to the properties of deep and nonlinear network. As the major contribution and a first step, we propose a reformulation that explicitly relates data distribution to the gradient descent optimization procedure. With this reformulation, we now can explicitly study how data distribution affects the property of the network. Along this direction, we put a few initial discussions in the paper. An application of this reformulation towards a major theorem is left to future work. 

Besides, we also discover a property of back-propagated gradient of BatchNorm (Sec. 4) and show that this property is preserved in the reformulation. 

2. [R1][R2] How teacher is defined.

The teacher is specified in a bottom-up manner (rather than top-down, as suggested by the reviewer 2). First the lowest layers of summarization is computed, then the second lowest layer of summarization is computed based on the lowest layers (ref. Sec 3.1: z_\alpha = z_\alpha(z_\beta)), until the top-level summarization is computed, which is the class label y. At each stage, we assume that the upwards function be deterministic and typically drop irrelevant information w.r.t the class label. The reason why we want a deterministic function is for the proof of Theorem 2. Note that while top-down graphical model requires nondeterministic function (since new information needs to be added), assuming deterministic function in a bottom-up setting is natural. 

3. [R2] How z_\alpha is picked and how to define P(x_\alpha|z_\alpha):

z_\alpha is picked by the teacher. Since the teacher provides the classification labels for the student, any choice of z_\alpha would fit to the theory. Intuitively, z_\alpha is a summarization of the content x_\alpha within the receptive field \alpha, which contributes to the final label y.  

Due to a loss of information, there are multiple x_\alpha that maps to the same z_\alpha. Therefore, we can define P(x_\alpha|z_\alpha). 

4. [R2][R3] Is the assumption in Theorem 2 (and 3) realistic? 

Typically, z_\alpha and z_\beta are overlapping (Fig. 1(b)). In particular, if \alpha is a parent of \beta, then the receptive field \alpha covers \beta. With this in mind, the two assumptions in Theorem 2: 

          P(x_\alpha|z_\alpha, z_\beta) = P(x_\alpha|z_\alpha) 

                 and 

          P(x_\beta|z_\alpha, z_\beta) = P(x_\beta|z_\beta) 

are natural, since each z is most related to the information of its own receptive field. 

Theorem 3 is a limiting case of Theorem 2, which gives an example about when the assumptions of theorem 2 hold exactly. If the assumptions of Theorem 2 are relaxed (e.g., ||P(x_\alpha|z_\alpha, z_\beta) - P(x_\alpha|z_\alpha)|| \le \epsilon), still we have bounds (instead of equalities) in Theorem 2.  

5. [R1] The data distribution is indirectly characterized by the conditional distribution P(z_\alpha | z_\beta), which may not be ideal/questionable. 

We think it is more like a merit rather than a shortcoming. An indirect specification (like what we give in the paper) gives much more flexibility of the distribution x. In contrast, a direct/parametric specification (e.g., the input data is Gaussian) might look mathematically clear but is probably not true in practice. On the other hand, given this indirect specification, we agree that the resulting distribution of input deserves further empirical study (e.g., via sampling x given z). 

 6. [R1] Empirical study
We will add more empirical studies in the next revision. We already observe the convergence of the reformulations (Theorem 2) under random conditional distribution of summarization variable (P(z_\alpha|z_\beta)), and much faster convergence if BatchNorm is used.

Using a teacher-student setting, this paper studies the batch normalization and the disentangled representations of neural networks. However, the definitions of some of the concepts and notation are not sufficiently clear. In addition, the assumptions that the main results of this paper depend on do not have clear intuitions.

Detailed comments:

1. It seems that this paper over claims its contribution. It is not clear why the "teacher-student setting" can be called a theoretical framework, even the definitions of the teacher and the student are not clear. It seems that the new framework is just a way to compute the relations of the gradients of neurons based on a few assumptions (Theorem 2).

2. I found it very hard to follow the notations given in this paper. The main reason is that many of the terms appear without a definition, and the reader has to guess what they stand for. For example, in equation (2), w_{jk} seems to be the weight between nodes j and k, where k is a child of j. But this term is not defined. As another example, all the matrices in Theorem 9 are not defined. They just suddenly appear. In addition, S(f) in (11) is not defined. I would suggest the authors to spend one section to carefully define everything. 

3. The theorems all depends on some assumptions that are unclear whether will hold in practice or not. For example, in theorem 2, it is hard to see what kind of data distribution satisfy these three conditions. Although in Theorem 3 the author gave a sufficient condition, we still don't know what kind of $X$ satisfies this. For example, does Gaussian distribution satisfy those? This problem also happens to other theorems. It would be much better to make sure that these assumptions are unrealistic.

The framework explicitly formulates data distribution, which has not been considered by previous works. The authors also show that their framework is compatible with Batch Normalization and favors disentangled representation when data distributions have factorizable structures. Based on this framework, the authors re-explain some common issues of deep learning, such as overfitting. 

My major concerns are as follows.

1. The framework is based on the teacher-student setting, and the authors claim that "the teacher generates classification label via a hidden computational graph". However, how the teacher can be designed is not clear in the paper.

2. The data distribution included in this paper is $P(z_{\alpha}, z_{\beta})$, where $z_{\alpha}$ and $z_{\beta}$ are all summarization variables. From this perspective, it only has an indirect connection with original data distribution $P(x)$ or $P(x_{\alpha}, x_{\beta})$, and thus it could be questionable whether $P(z_{\alpha}, z_{\beta})$ is a convincing representation.

3. The authors may want to conduct more experiments to better support their claims.

The main idea seems to be that the network is sparsely connected, so each neuron is not going to have access to the entire input. One can then think about the gradient of this neuron locally while average out over all the randomness in the input locations that are not relevant to this neuron. Using this framework the paper tried to explain several phenomena in neural networks, including batch normalization, overfitting, disentangling, etc.

I feel the paper is poorly written which made it very hard to understand. For example, as the paper states, the model gives a generative model for input (x,y) pairs. However, I could not find a self-contained description of how this generative model works. Some things are described in Section 3.1 about the discrete summarization variables, but the short paragraph did not describe: (a) What is the "multi-layer" deterministic function? (b) How are these z_\alpha's chosen? (c) Given z's how do we generate x? (d) What happens if we have z_\alpha and z_\beta and the regions \alpha and \beta are not disjoint? What x do we use in the intersection?

In trying to understand the paper, I was thinking that (a)(b) The multilayer deterministic function is a function which gives a tree structure over the z_\alpha's, where y is the root. (I have no idea why this should be a deterministic function, intuitively shouldn't y be chosen randomly, and each z_\alpha chosen randomly conditioned on its parent?)  (c) there is a fixed conditional distribution of P(x_\alpha|z_\alpha), and I really could not figure out (d). The paper definitely seems to allow two receptive fields to intersect as in Figure 1(b).

Without understanding the generative model, it is impossible for me to evaluate the later results. My general comments there is that there are no clear Theorems that summarizes the results (the Theorems in the paper are all just Lemmas that are trying to work towards the final goal of giving some explanations, but the explanations and assumptions are not formally written down). Looking at things separately (as again I couldn't understand the single paragraph describing the generative model), the Assumption in Theorem 3 seems extremely limiting as it is saying that x_j is a discrete distribution (which is probably never true in practice). I wouldn't say "the model does not impose unrealistic assumptions" in abstract if you are going to assume this, rather the model just makes a different kind of unrealistic assumptions (Assumptions in Theorem 2 might be much weaker, but it's hard to judge that).</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1edfAN19m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Insufficient Exposition of Previous Works</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyeKf30cFQ&amp;noteId=S1edfAN19m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Oct 2018 (modified: 02 Oct 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1284 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">This is really an interesting and technical theoretical paper.

We appreciate your interest to our paper. 

We totally agree that there should be more related works in the submission, in particular for the great work on theoretical foundation of information bottleneck. We will add them in the next revision. 

We want to emphasize that there is one substantial difference between our work and the works of information bottleneck: we model data distribution as explicit terms in our reformulation of deep and locally connected nonlinear network. To our best knowledge, this is novel.  By imposing different conditions on the data distribution, there could be many interesting consequences. In our paper, we only barely scratch the surface. 

For mathematical rigorousness: Given the assumptions in the paper are true, to our best knowledge and efforts, all the statements named "theorems" in our paper are rigorous. You can check the Appendix for all the detailed proofs. Note that it is totally possible that we might make mistakes. If so we would happily revise the paper and/or retract. 

We are looking forward to your detailed comments. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
