The fast generator is trained to mimic the PixelCNN generator but, instead of generating the pixels sequentially, generates them in one shot. A confidence estimator is also trained to assign a score to pixels generated by the fast generator. If the score is low for a pixel, the system uses PixelCNN to generate the pixel instead. The fast generator is implemented with a UNET architecture  and uses a set of latent pixels that are independent of each other and can be used to generate the new pixel in one shot. 

Experiments are conducted using CelebA and CIFAR-10 datasets. Analysis is presented that 1) shows acceleration versus degradation by varying the confidence threshold. 2) show the confidence map versus the perceptual quality. The acceleration obtained ranges from 1x to 60x depending how aggressively the threshold is set. A perceptual score (FID - Frechet Inception Score) is used to measure the quality of generated images. The experiments show, surprisingly, that the FID follows a curve as the threshold is varied and the extrema is around 0.4. Thus the authors imply that their method can improve perceptual quality, which is nonsense. Indeed the FID score should use an Inception model trained on the same data to be meaningful. Also, a look at the generated images show substantial artifacts for e=0.r compared to e=1.0 (no skimming). Confidence maps also show a lot of raster line artifacts. These artifacts should be explained. Also, the authors hint at using anchor pixels (generated by PixelCNN) at the start of the generation loop to presumably improve the quality. Are the FID scores given in table 1 using anchors or not ? The acceleration bar graph in figure 4(a) is without anchors, so the FID scores should also be without anchors. Finally, the full training procedure is quite complicated and probably slow. There should be some discussion on that.

The article is technically sound. The citations are extensive. The math is well laid out and adequately referenced. The English is fine with some missing articles being the only issue. The figures are readable and well captioned.

Overall, I find this paper not very significant. It proposes an acceleration for PixelCNN but the trade-off in quality is not well discussed. It would be better to compare classification accuracy of corrupted images fixed by the method, for example.

The authors propose a generative image model based on Pixel-CNNs, they introduce components that allow the model to generate multiple pixels in parallel, instead of purely sequentially. 
The model switches automatically between fully sequential mode and partially parallel mode based on a module that predicts the confidence in the parallel predicted pixel values.
Experimental validation of the model is performed using the CelebA and CIFAR10 datasets. The authors also show qualitative examples of conditional generation for a model trained on ImageNet. 
The proposed model achieves a speed up of about 5 to 10 times, wrt a baseline pixelCNN++ model. 

A "fast generator network", f, is used to predict a set of B pixels following pixel i in parallel at once, conditioned on the pixels 1 up to i generated so far.
This is done by using a conventional pixel-CNN to predict the B pixels in the set following i, conditioned in this case on the output of the fast generator rather than the sampled values of the preceding pixels in the set. 

One of the main drawbacks of the proposed method is that the authors are not able to provide negative log-likelihood (NLL) scores on held-out data for non-trivial settings of the threshold parameter epsilon. As is, the authors only provide NLL for epsilon equal to 0 or 1, in which cases the model reverts to a plain pixelCNN, or to a skim-only version of the proposed model. Therefore, there is no quantitative evaluation in terms of NLL of the more interesting cases where epsilon is between 0 and 1. 
The model lacks therefore one of the attractive properties of pixelCNNs: the tractable likelihood computation. 
As a result, the model is trained in three parts the optimize the performance of (i) the per-pixel pixelCNN model, (ii) the skim-ahead prediction model, and (iii) the gating module that predicts which of the two generators should be used.
It is not completely clear how the targets for the gating module are defined, see below.

The paper misses an important reference to Reed et al., 2017. Which proposes another fast pixel-CNN model, by imposing partial pixel independence structure. Discussion and experimental comparison to this model should be added to the paper.  
Reed et al. Parallel Multiscale Autoregressive Density Estimation, ICML'17

Other important references include models that combine a VAE model with a (light) pixelCNN decoder, to benefit from a fast overall generation of the main image content, and detailed AR pixelCNN model to obtain sharp detail. There is no qualitative or quantitative comparison to such models, nor discussion in the related work section. 
Chen et al.  Variational Lossy Autoencoder, ICLR'17
Guljarani et al.  PixelVAE: A Latent Variable Model for Natural Images, ICLR'17

More generally, the paper lacks any direct quantitative and qualitative comparison to the literature, except for pixelCNN++.

What do the authors precisely mean with the statement "..., our model achieves the state of the art performance on the generation speed of the AR models". 
Should such a statement not involve both speed and quantitative performance, since a fast algorithm is not hard to design, a fast one with non-trivial performance however is more interesting. Given the presented experimental data, there seems to be no support for this claim.

Specific comments:

- The "approximate" distribution q defined in section 3.2 is introduced without explaining what is approximated and why. 
The presentation could be improved by clearly motivating this approximation and its role in the model at this point.   
It becomes clear upon a second reading, but at first this section is a little confusing, as it alludes to approximate distributions as used in variational methods, using similar notation (q and phi) as used for amortized inference networks.

- Equation 5 provides a loss to train W and theta, but it was not clear to me why it is based on samples from the pixelCNN, which themselves depend on theta, rather than on ground-truth pixels. The dependence of these samples on theta seems to be ignored. Please clarify this point.

- What is f_k precisely defined in equation 7? How does it differ, if at all, from the conditional distribution defined in equation 3?

- How is the hyper parameter B, which controls the size of the skim-ahead model, set in the experiments? 
What happens for different settings of the buffer size B?

- The results in figure 3 show a clear horizontal striping pattern in the confidence maps. 
Where does this come from, which part of the model is reflected by this striping?

- The scale of figure 4c is unclear: what do you mean with "Ã—10$%" ?!

- The results in table 3 show a comparison to pixel-CNN++. For the proposed model, in the no-skimming setting: what is the difference with pixel-CNN++ in this case? Shouldn't it be exactly the same, and therefore no wonder that you get a similar NLL?

Generating from autoregressive image models such as PixelCNN is slow, because each pixel must be generated sequentially. The paper proposes a method for speeding up generation from PixelCNN. The idea is to train two additional models together with PixelCNN: a fast generator and a confidence model. The fast generator predicts the next few pixels in the image (e.g. the next row) in parallel. The confidence model scores each predicted pixel with how likely it is to have been generated by the original PixelCNN. Only pixels with a low confidence score are generated by the PixelCNN, whereas the rest are taken from the fast generator.

Technical quality:

The proposed method for speeding up generation from PixelCNN is a nice idea. The proposed implementation is sensible, and the experimental evaluation is reasonable.

It's important to note that the fast generator proposed in the paper is a rather weak generative model, as it's strictly more limited than the original PixelCNN. If I understand correctly, the "prior pixels" z_{i..j} are a deterministic function of the previous pixels x_{&lt;i}, and the predicted pixels x_{i..j} are conditionally independent given x_{&lt;i} under the fast generator. This is a modelling limitation that will only be accurate locally in smooth images (such as faces). Saying that "q will approach p if z_{i..j} approaches x_{i..j}" (bottom of page 3 and appendix B) doesn't make sense to me; this cannot possibly happen, as z_{i..j} is a deterministic function of x_{&lt;i} whereas x_{i..j} is a random variable given x_{&lt;i}.

In my opinion, the experimental evaluation should report the log likelihood of samples generated from the Skim-PixelCNN under the original PixelCNN, for various values of epsilon. Such an experiment would quantify the discrepancy between Skim-PixelCNN and the original PixelCNN. A graph showing the trade-off between this discrepancy and generation speed-up would be an important result to report.

The paper says that the method has been evaluated on CIFAR-10, but the reported evaluation on CIFAR-10 is much less thorough than the one on CelebA. I think the paper should report the evaluation on both datasets equally thoroughly. Right now, the claim in the abstract that the evaluation has been done on "diverse image datasets" cannot be substantiated. My expectation is that the method works better on CelebA than CIFAR-10, because face images are fairly smooth.

Originality:

As far as I know, the idea and the proposed implementation are original and interesting contributions.

I think the discussion of related work is limited. In my opinion, the related work section should also discuss flow-based models such as Real NVP, Glow, Masked Autoregressive Flow and Inverse Autoregressive Flow, some of which are fast to generate from. More importantly, the related work section should discuss other ways of speeding up generation from autoregressive models, such as those used in Parallel WaveNet.

Clarity:

The paper is well structured and organized into sections, and the main idea is clearly stated from the beginning. However, in terms of language, grammar, expression and choice of vocabulary the paper is below publication standard and needs to be improved.

Significance:

I believe that the problem the paper tackles is an important one. Autoregressive models perform very well in terms of log-likelihood, but are slow to sample from which limits their applicability. On the other hand, models that are fast to sample from often don't provide exact log-likelihoods. In practice we often need both, and finding ways in which we can speed-up generation from autoregressive models is a way of achieving this.

Having said that, it's important to note that Skim-PixelCNN still samples autoregressively (e.g. one row at a time for epsilon = 1) and therefore doesn't completely solve the problem. The question is, when should one prefer Skim-PixelCNN versus e.g. distilling PixelCNN to a fast flow-based model (such as done with Parallel WaveNet)? I think the paper should include such a discussion.

Review summary:

Pros:
+ Nice idea, sensible implementation.
+ Well structured, main idea clearly stated from start.
+ Evaluation is reasonable.

Cons:
- Poorly written in terms of language.
- Evaluation incomplete, should include results on CIFAR-10 and quantify discrepancy with original PixelCNN vs generation speed-up.
- Related work incomplete: should discuss at least flow-based models and Parallel WaveNet.

Minor points:
- Some citations are incorrect. For example, video generation cites WaveNet (first paragraph of introduction), and GANs cite adversarial examples (fist paragraph of related work).
- Fist paragraph of introduction: the characterization of a GAN as a "point estimator" doesn't make sense to me.
- "j &gt; i for all i, j in [1, n^2]" doesn't make sense. Just writing "j &gt;i" is enough here.
- Beginning of section 3.3 says that the fast generator must be corrected because "it's autoregressive and hence accumulates error". This is not the reason; as I explained above, the reason is that the fast generator is a weak model. Accumulation of error due to autoregressive sampling affects the fast generator no more than it affects the original PixelCNN.
- Figure 4(c), vertical axis says 10^$%.
- In conclusions: I don't think that Skim-PixelCNN has achieved "SOTA performance" in any sense. It's not the fastest model to generate from (GANs, VAEs and flows are), and it's not better at modelling than the original PixelCNN.
- Algorithm 1: indices v^(i) and k^(i) are used inconsistently. Also, removing ^(i) as it's unnecessary will improve clarity.
- Algorithm 2, line 16: shouldn't g_V also take d[&lt;=i] as input?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
