However, they are both complex and memory intensive due to their recursive nature. These limitations make RNNs difficult to embed on mobile devices requiring real-time processes with limited hardware resources. To address the above issues, we introduce a method that can learn binary and ternary weights during the training phase to facilitate hardware implementations of RNNs. As a result, using this approach replaces all multiply-accumulate operations by simple accumulations, bringing significant benefits to custom hardware in terms of silicon area and power consumption. On the software side, we evaluate the performance (in terms of accuracy) of our method using long short-term memories (LSTMs) on various sequential models including sequence classification and language modeling. We demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results on the aforementioned tasks while using binary/ternary weights during the runtime. On the hardware side, we present custom hardware for accelerating the recurrent computations of LSTMs with binary/ternary weights. Ultimately, we show that LSTMs with binary/ternary weights can achieve up to 12x memory saving and 10x inference speedup compared to the full-precision implementation on an ASIC platform.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Quantized Recurrent Neural Network, Hardware Implementation, Deep Learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We propose high-performance LSTMs with binary/ternary weights, that can greatly reduce implementation complexity</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJlRfyx_aQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Achieving binary/ternary LSTMs using batch normalization within recurrent layers</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNGYjR9FX&amp;noteId=HJlRfyx_aQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper427 AnonReviewer4</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">13 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper427 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper proposes a method to achieve binary and ternary quantization for recurrent networks. The key contribution is applying batch normalization to both input matrix vector and hidden matrix vector products within recurrent layers in order to preserve accuracy. The authors demonstrate accuracy benefits on a variety of datasets including language modeling (character and word level), MNIST sequence, and question answering. A hardware implementation based on DaDianNao is provided as well.

Strengths
- The authors propose a relatively simple and easy to understand methodology for achieving aggressive binary and ternary quantization.
- The authors present compelling accuracy benefits on a range of datasets.

Weaknesses / Questions
- While the application of batch normalization demonstrates good results, having more compelling results on why covariate shift is such a problem in LSTMs would be helpful. Is this methodology applicable to other recurrent layers like RNNs and GRUs? 
- Does applying batch normalization across layer boundaries or at the end of each time-step help? This may incur lower overhead during inference and training time compared to applying batch normalization to the output of each matrix vector product (inputs and hidden-states). 
- Does training with batch-normalization add additional complexity to the training process? I imagine current DL framework do not efficiently parallelize applying batch normalization on both input and hidden matrix vector products.
- It would be nice to have more intuition on what execution time overheads batch-normalization applies during inference on a CPU or GPU. That is, without a hardware accelerator what are the run-time costs, if any.
- The hardware implementation could have much more detail. First, where are the area and power savings coming from. It would be nice to have a breakdown of on-chip SRAM for weights and activations vs. required DRAM memory. Similarly having a breakdown of power in terms of on-chip memory, off-chip memory, and compute would be helpful. 
- The hardware accelerator baseline assumes a 12-bit weight and activation quantization. Is this the best that can be achieved without sacrificing accuracy compared to floating point representation? Does adding batch normalization to intermediate matrix-vector products increase the required bit width for activations to preserve accuracy?

Other comments
- Preceding section 3.2 there no real discussion on batch normalization and covariate shift which are central to the work’s contribution. It would be nice to include this in the introduction to guide the reader.
- It is unclear why DaDianNao was chosen as the baseline hardware implementation as opposed to other hardware accelerator implementations such as TPU like dataflows or the open-source NVDLA.

The authors argue that binarising RNNs is due to a covariate shift, and address it with stochastic quantised weights and batch normalisation.
The proposed RNN is tested on 6 sequence modelling tasks/datasets and shows drastic memory improvements compared to full-precision RNNs, with almost no loss in test performance.
Based on the more efficient RNN cell, the authors furthermore describe a more efficient hardware implementation, compared to an implementation of the full-precision RNN.

The core message I took away from this work is: “One can get away with stochastic binarised weights in a forward pass by compensating for it with batch normalisation”.

Strengths:
- substantial number of experiments (6 datasets), different domains
- surprisingly simple methodological fix 
- substantial literature review
- it has been argued that char-level / pixel-level RNNs present somewhat artificial tasks — even better that the authors test for a more realistic RNN application (Reading Comprehension) with an actually previously published model.

Weaknesses:
- little understanding is provided into _why_ covariance shift occurs/ why batch normalisation is so useful. The method works, but the authors could elaborate more on this, given that this is the core argument motivating the chosen method.
- some statements are too bold/vague , e.g. page 3: “a binary/ternary model that can perform all temporal tasks”
- unclear: by adapting a probabilistic formulation / sampling quantised weights, some variance is introduced. Does it matter for predictions (which should now also be stochastic)? How large is this variance? Even if negligible, it is not obvious and should be addressed.


Other Questions / Comments
-  How dependent is the method on the batch size chosen? This is in particular relevant as smaller batches might yield poor empirical estimates for mean/var. What happens at batch size 1? Are predictions of poorer for smaller batches?
- Section 2, second line — detail: case w_{i,j}=0 is not covered
- equation (5): total probability mass does not add up to 1
- a direct comparison with models from previous work would have been interesting, where these previous methods also rely on batch normalisation
- as I understand, the main contribution is in the inference (forward pass), not in training. It is somewhat misleading when the authors speak about “the proposed training algorithm” or “we introduced a training algorithm”
- unclear: last sentence before section 6.

This paper proposes batch normalization for learning RNNs with binary or ternary weights instead of full-precision weights. Experiments are carried out on character-level and word-level language modeling, as well as sequential MNIST and question answering.


* Strengths
- I liked the variety of tasks used evaluations (sequential MNIST, language modeling, question answering).
- Encouraging results on specialized hardware implementation.


* Weaknesses
- Using batch normalization on existing binarization/ternarization techniques is a bit of an incremental contribution.
- All test perplexities for word-level language models in table 3 underperform compared to current vanilla LSTMs for that task (see Table 4 in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05589.pdf)," target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05589.pdf),</a> suggesting that the baseline LSTM used in this paper is not strong enough.
- Results on question answering are not convincing -- BinaryConnect has the same size while achieving substantially higher accuracy (94.66% vs 40.78%). This is nowhere discussed and the paper's major claims "binaryconnect method fails" and "our method [...] outperforms all the existing quantization methods" seem unfounded (Section 5.5).
- In the introduction, I am lacking a distinction between improvements w.r.t. training vs inference time. As far as I understand, quantization methods only help at reducing memory footprint or computation time during inference/test but not during training. This should be clarified.
- In the introduction on page 2 is argued that the proposed method "eliminates the need for multiplications" -- I do not see how this is possible. Maybe what you meant is that it eliminates the need for full-precision multiplications by replacing them with multiplications with binary/ternary matrices? 
- The notation is quite confusing. For starters, in Section 2 you mention "a fixed scaling factor A" and I would encourage you to indicate scalars by lower-case letters, vectors by boldface lower-case letters and matrices by boldface upper-case letters. Moreover, it is unclear when calculations are approximate. For instance, in Eq. 1 I believe you need to replace "=" with "\approx". Likewise for the equation in the next to last line on page 2. Lastly, while Eq. 2 seems to be a common way to write down LSTM equations, it is abusive notation.


* Minor Comments
- Abstract: What is ASIC? It is not referenced in Section 6.
- Introduction: What is the justification for calling RNNs over-parameterized? This seems to depend on the task. 
- Introduction; contributions: Here, I would like to see a distinction between gains during training vs test time.
- Section 3.2 comes out of nowhere. You might want to already mention why are introducing batch normalization at this point.
- The boldfacing in Table 1, 2 and 3 is misleading. I understand this is done to highlight the proposed method, but I think commonly boldfacing is used to highlight the best results.
- Figure 2b. What is your hypothesis why BPC actually goes down the longer the sequence is?
- Algorithm 1, line 14: Using the cross-entropy is a specific choice dependent on the task. My understanding is your approach can work with any differentiable downstream loss?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
