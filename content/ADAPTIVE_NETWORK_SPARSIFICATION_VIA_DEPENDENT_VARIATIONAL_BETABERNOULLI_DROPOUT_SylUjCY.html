With such input-independent dropout, each neuron is evolved to be generic across inputs, which makes it difficult to sparsify networks without accuracy loss. To overcome this limitation, we propose adaptive variational dropout whose probabilities are drawn from sparsity-inducing beta-Bernoulli prior. It allows each neuron to be evolved either to be generic or specific for certain inputs, or dropped altogether. Such input-adaptive sparsity-inducing dropout allows the resulting network to tolerate larger degree of sparsity without losing its expressive power by removing redundancies among features. We validate our dependent variational beta-Bernoulli dropout on multiple public datasets, on which it obtains significantly more compact networks than baseline methods, with consistent accuracy improvements over the base networks.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Bayesian deep learning, network pruning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We propose a novel Bayesian network sparsification method that adaptively prunes networks according to inputs.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HyejvX5hnQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Confusion about inference</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SylU3jC5Y7&amp;noteId=HyejvX5hnQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper714 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">04 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper714 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors propose a dropout method that uses the beta-Bernoulli process to learn the sparsity rate for each node. 

The model itself make sense to me, though I don't have an understanding of why learning a node-specific sparsity rate should improve dropout -- i.e., what is there to learn? From what I understand about dropout, it's a stochastic method that has the same marginal as the original model, but because of the randomness induced it avoids bad local optimal solutions. Thus it's a learning trick, not a modeling technique. This treats dropout as something to directly model.

My confusion is mainly about inference. While there are many approximations introduced to make it work, if the sparsity z is something to be learned then why is it only being sampled from the beta prior in (15)? There is a likelihood term that incorporates z as well and it seems like this should be included as well to be strictly correct from a modeling standpoint. I didn't see any explanation in the discussion.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HyeKbrJc27" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting paper that needs more work</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SylU3jC5Y7&amp;noteId=HyeKbrJc27"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper714 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper714 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This work proposes Variational Beta-Bernoulli Dropout, a Bayesian way to sparsify neural networks by adopting Spike and Slab priors over the parameters of the network. Motivated by the Indian Buffet Process the authors further adopt Beta hyperpriors for the parameters of the Bernoulli distribution and also propose a way to set up the model such that it allows for input specific priors over the Bernoulli distributions. They then provide the necessary details for their variational approximations to the posterior distributions of both such models and experimentally validate their performance on the tasks of MNIST and CIFAR 10/100 classification.

This work is in general well written and conveys the main ideas in an clear manner. Furthermore, parametrising conditional group sparsity in a Bayesian way is also an interesting venue for research that can further facilitate for computational speedups for neural networks. The overall method seems simple to implement and doesn’t introduce too many extra learnable parameters.

Nevertheless, I believe that this paper needs more work in order to be published. More specifically:

- I believe that the authors need to further elaborate and compare with “Generalized Dropout”; the prior imposed on the weights for the non-dependent case is essentially the same with only small differences in the approximate posterior. Both methods seem to optimise, rather than integrate over, the weights of the network and the main difference is in how to handle the approximate distributions over the gates. Why would one prefer one parametrisation rather than the other? Furthermore, the authors of this work argue that they employ asymptotically unbiased gradients for the binary random variables, which is incorrect as the continuous relaxation provides a biased gradient estimator for the underlying discrete model.

- At section 3.2 the authors argue about the inherent sparsity inducing nature of the IBP model. In the finite K scenario this is not entirely the case as sparsity is only encouraged for alpha &lt; K.

- At Eq. 11 the index “n” doesn’t make sense as the Bernoulli probability for each point depends only on the global pi_k. Similarly for Eq. 12.

- Since you tie q(z_nk|pi_k) = p(z_nk|pi_k) then it makes sense to phrase Eq.16 as just D_KL(q(pi) || p(pi)). Furthermore, I believe that you should properly motivate on why tying these two is a sensible thing to do.

- Figure 1 is misleading; you start from a unimodal distribution and then you simply apply a scalar scale and shift to the elements of that distribution. The output of that will always be a unimodal distribution but somehow you end up with a multimodal distribution on the third part of the figure. As a result, I believe that in this case you will not have two clear modes (one at 0 and one at 1) when you apply the hard-sigmoid rectification.

- The motivation for 21 seems a bit confusing to me; what do you mean with insignificant dimensions? What overflow does the epsilon prevent? If the input to the hard sigmoid is a N(0, 1) distribution then you will approximately have 1/3 of the activations having probability close to 1. Furthermore, it seems that you want beta to be small / negative to get sparse outcomes but the text implies that you want it to be large.

- It would be better to rewrite eq. 22 to include also the fact that you have a separate z per layer as currently it seems that the there is only one z. Furthermore, you have written that the variational posterior distribution depends on x_n on the RHS but not on the LHS.

- Above eq. 23 seems that it should be q(z_nk| pi_k, xn) = p(z_nk| pi_k, xn) rather than q(z_nk| pi_k) = p(z_nk| pi_k, xn)


Regarding the experiments; the MNIST results are not particularly convincing as the numbers are, in general, similar to other methods. Furthermore, Figure 2 is a bit small and confusing to read. Should FLOPS be on the y-axis or something else? Almost zero flops for the original model doesn’t seem right. Finally, at the CIFAR 10/100 experiment it seems that both BB and DBB achieve the best performance. However, it seems that the accuracy /sparsity obtained for the baselines is inferior to the results obtained on each of the respective papers. For example, SBP managed to get a 2.71x speedup with the VGG on CIFAR 10 and an error of 7.5%, whereas here the error was 8.68% with just 1.34x speedup. The extra visualisations provided at Figure 3 do look interesting though as it shows what the sparsity patterns learn.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Byx1wGww2Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Novel idea to improve compression with data-dependent structured dropout.

------------------

The authors propose a new method to sparsify DNNs based on a dropout induced by a Beta-Bernoulli prior. They further propose a data-dependent dropout by linking the Beta-Bernoulli prevalence to the inputs, achieving a higher sparsification rate. In the experimental section they show that the proposed method achieves better compression rates than other methods in the literature. However, experiments against some recent methods are missing. Also, some additional experiments using data-dependent dropouts not based on the Beta-Bernoulli prior would help to better disentangle the effects of the two contributions of the paper. Overall, the paper is well-written but the mentioning of the IBP is confusing. The authors devote quite a bit of space to the IBP when it is actually not used at all.

 Detailed comments
-------------------------

1)	Introduction

The paper is well motivated and the introduction of the paper clearly states the two main contributions of the paper: a Beta-Bernoulli dropout prior and a dependent Beta Bernoulli dropout prior. 

2)	Background

Section 3.1 is a nice summary of variational inference for BNNs. On the other hand, Section 3.2 is misleading. The authors use this section to introduce the IBP process (a generative sequential process to generate samples from a random measure called the Beta-Bernoulli process). However, this is not used in the paper at all. Then they introduce the Beta-Bernoulli prior as a finite Beta-Bernoulli process. I find this quite convoluted. I would suggest to introduce the Beta-Bernoulli distribution as a prior directly, and state that for alpha/K this is a sparse-inducing prior (where the average number of features is given by \frac{\alpha}{1 + \frac{\alpha}{K} ). No need to mention the IBP or the Beta Bernoulli process. 

3)	Main Contribution

I think the design of a link function that allows to implement a data-dependent Beta-Bernoulli dropout is one of the keys of the paper and I would suggest that the author clearly state this contribution at the beginning of the paper. I would also like to see the application of this link-function to other sparsity inducing priors different than the Beta-Bernoulli. This would allow to further understand the data-dependent contribution to the final performance and how transferable this is to other settings. Also, Have the authors try to train the data-dependent Beta-Bernoulli from scratch, i.e. without the two steps approach? I am assuming the performance is worse, but I would publish the results for completeness.

4)	Experiments

The main issues with the experimental section are:
a)	I am missing some recent methods (some of them even cited in the related work section): e.g. Louizos et al. (2017). I would be interested in comparisons against the horshoe-prior and a data-dependent version of it. Also, a recent paper based on the variational information bottleneck have been recently published outperforming the state of the art in the field (<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/dai18d.html)." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/dai18d.html).</a>
b)	Table 1 should report the variance or other uncertainty measure: Given that they run the experiments 5 times, I do not understand why they only report the median. I would encourage the authors to publish the mean and the variance (at least).
In addition, one of my main question about the method is, once the network has been sparsified, how does this translate into a real performance improvement (in terms of memory and speed). In term of memory, you can always apply a standard compression algorithm. If the sparsity is about a certain threshold, you can resort to sparse-matrix implementations. However, regarding the speed only when you reach a certain sparsity level you would get a tangible improvement if your DL framework support sparse matrices. However, if you get an sparsity level below this threshold, e.g. 20%, you cannot resort to sparse matrices and therefore you would not get a speed improvement, unless you enforce structure sparsity or you optimize to low-level matrix multiplication routines. Are the Speedup/Memory results reported in Table 1 real or theoretical?
