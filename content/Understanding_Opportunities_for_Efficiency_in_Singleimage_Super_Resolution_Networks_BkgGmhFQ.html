Naturally, SR is of value to resource constrained devices like mobile phones, electronic photograph frames and hoe televisions to enhance image quality. However, SR demands perhaps the most extreme amounts of memory and compute operations of any mainstream vision task known today. And this in-turn prevents SR from being deployed to devices that require them. In this paper, we perform one of the only systematic studies of system resource efficiency for SR, within the context of a variety of architectural and low-precision approaches originally developed for discriminative neural networks. We present a rich set of insights, representative SR architectures and efficiency trade-offs; for example, highly compact SR models suitable for DSPs and FPGAs -- along with SR models suitable for smartphones that are 3x smaller than those of comparable quality found in the literature. Collectively, we believe these results provides the foundation for further research into the little explored area of resource efficiency for SR. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Super-Resolution, Resource-Efficiency</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We build an understanding of resource-efficient techniques on Super-Resolution</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_ryeByNe1aX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>summary of known ideas / no new ideas / no better results than other from the SR literature</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkgGmh09FQ&amp;noteId=ryeByNe1aX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1338 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1338 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors target single-image super-resolution (SR) task and study the efficiency (runtime, memory) of the current neural networks.

On the positive side, the paper is a good effort of bringing together works and insights related to efficient designs and efficient SR solutions.

If we report to the baseline architecture (RCAN) then the proposed efficient variants achieves large reductions in number of parameters or multiplications-additions, at the cost of lower accuracy. However, when the newly proposed trade-offs are compared with the existing literature, we see other methods that do a comparable or better job in the same range.

On the negative side, from my point of view, the study is far from being thorough and does not lead to or bring new insights or ideas. The experimental results does not reveal new operating points (trade-off between complexity/operations and performance accuracy).

I would suggest to the authors to expand their study, to make some novel observations, and to propose some designs that can stand out in the literature.

I am pointing out also to some recent papers that are related to the topic and can be or are applied to SR:

The paper proposes a detailed empirical evaluation of the trade-offs achieved by various convolutional neural networks on the super resolution problem. The paper provides an extensive evaluation of different architectural changes and the trade-off between savings in terms of memory and computational cost and performance, measured in terms of PSNR and SSIM.

This is an empirical paper, thus it does not provide technical contributions. I do think that the insights obtained from such an empirical evaluation could be of interest for practitioners and researchers working on the problem. My main concern is the method only evaluates the trade-offs between model efficiency (in terms of memory and/or computation) and performance measured using metrics that are known to not be well correlated with perceptual quality. Thus it is not obvious to me that the insights obtained in this work would translate to the other case.

It is well known that PSNR favors blurry solutions over perceptually more appealing solutions. This comes from the fact that there is no information in the low resolution image to produce the missing high resolution details. Filling up plausible details in a way that is different from the original image would lead to high PSNR. Models that treat the super resolution problem as a regression task using similarity in pixel space, tend to produce blurry solutions and require very large models to improve the score.  

In recent years, many works have been studying the use of perceptual losses to mitigate this issue or simply treating the super resolution problem as conditional generative modeling.  For instance, models using L2 losses in a perceptually more relevant (or learned) feature spaces [A, B], or including GAN losses [C, D] (to list a few). To my knowledge, these models are the current state of the art in terms of perceptual quality. This has been evaluated empirically via perceptual tests [D].  

This line of work needs to be cited. In my view, the paper needs to provide a detailed justification on why models using these losses are not considered. Would the conclusions drawn on this work transfer to that setting? Furthermore, it would be good to perform perceptual tests to perform this evaluation. It would be good to provide some canonical examples in the appendix.

The overall writing of the paper could be improved. Several sentences are difficult to read, due to typos or the construction of the sentences. The paper evaluates many architectural modifications proposed by other works. It would be good to add an appendix with a small description of what these are. This would make the paper self-contained an easier to read (I had too look up a few of them).

The authors mentioned that they first train models for scaling factor of x2 and then use them for training settings higher magnification. How is this exactly done? Please provide details.

I am curious of weather using some for of distillation techniques would be useful here.

Did you try scaling factors larger than x4? Scaling factors of x2 does not seem very relevant, as simpler methods can achieve already quite competitive results (such as simple interpolation methods)

The authors seem to be citing Zhang et al (2018) as a reference to attention mechanisms. To my knowledge the paper that proposed these mechanisms is [E].

The citation style is not used properly throughout the manuscript. As an example:

“… proposed in StrassenNets Tschannen et al (2017).” Should be “… proposed in StrassenNets (Tschannen et al, 2017).” Or “… proposed in StrassenNets proposed by Tschannen et al (2017).”

First, I am afraid all the techniques considered in this paper have been investigated in previous works. Thus no new idea is proposed in this work. Also, it is also not clear why these improvement is particularly suitable for the task of super resolution. In my viewpoint, these techniques actually can be used to improve a variety of network architectures in both high-level and low-level vision tasks.

Second, the experimental results are also weak. As this work is aiming to address the super resolution tasks, at least visual comparisons between the proposed methods and other state-of-the-art approaches should be included in the experimental part. But unfortunately, no such qualitative results are presented in the manuscript. 

Finally, the presentation of the paper should also be carefully proofread and revised.
