However, biological systems are notoriously difficult to describe analytically due to their many interacting components, and in many cases, the technical challenge of taking longitudinal measurements. This leads to difficulties in studying the features of the dynamics, for examples the drivers of the transition. To address this problem, we present a deep neural network framework we call Dynamics Modeling Network or DyMoN. DyMoN is a neural network framework trained as a deep generative Markov model whose next state is a probability distribution based on the current state. DyMoN is well-suited to the idiosyncrasies of biological data, including noise, sparsity, and the lack of longitudinal measurements in many types of systems. Thus, DyMoN can be trained using probability distributions derived from the data in any way, such as trajectories derived via dimensionality reduction methods, and does not require longitudinal measurements. We show the advantage of learning deep models over shallow models such as Kalman filters and hidden Markov models that do not learn representations of the data, both in terms of learning embeddings of the data and also in terms training efficiency, accuracy and ability to multitask. We perform three case studies of applying DyMoN to different types of biological systems and extracting features of the dynamics in each case by examining the learned model. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">neural networks, markovian dynamics, single-cell biology, calcium imaging, stochastic dynamics, generative models</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Dynamics Modeling Networks (DyMoN) offer advantages in representation, generation, visualization and feature extraction over shallow learning techniques for modeling stochastic dynamical systems in biology.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJgeVhWa3Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Modelling dynamics of biological data with deep Neural Networks (NN)</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1gARiAcFm&amp;noteId=HJgeVhWa3Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper945 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper945 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper tackles the important challenge of making sense of temporal measurements made in biological systems. Among other, those have the peculiarity that they are not independent but with a dependency structure, which can be encoded as a graph or a network. The authors claim that their approach, DyMoN is adapted to the many challenges of biological high-throughput data sets: noise, sparsity and lack of temporal resolution. The paper presents three very different use of the method in complex biological systems in Section 3: (i) Calcium imaging of visual cortex neurons, (ii) T--cell development in the thymus, and (iii) Human embryonic stem cell differentiation. Section 4 assesses the performance of the method on simulated data sets as well as on a face-recognition data set. Moreover, the authors demonstrate how the features of the NN can be interrogated to shed new insight about the process under scrutiny. They also show the gain in running time a comapred to other approaches.

Remarks:
 - I know very little about the literautr in the subject, could you clarify how your work relates to/can be distinguished from: Testolin and Zorzi, Front Comput Neurosci. 201, Kiegeskorte's Ann. Rev.

 - l-4p2: 'repetitions': what are those? Line below: 'sufficient for estimating $ P_{x}(y) $, means large sample size, no? No contradictory? And one line below: what is the precise meaning of 'similar' (twice)?
 - top p3: line continued from bottom of p2 -&gt; is it to rubber out noise?
what is $ n $ in $ \mathbb{R}^{n} $?
 - Make Fig 1 (B) and (C) clearer, since the transition vectors are learnt, why are they in (B) (input states)?
 - below "...distribution approximates the distribution $ \mathcal{P}_{x} $..." -&gt; but $ P_{x} $ also depends on $ \theta $, not an issue?
 - remark at the end of Section 2: extending DyMoN to higher-order: OK, but this might be computationally VERY expensive, don't you think?
 - link how your empirical validation data have features that, even remotely resemble those of the kind of biological data sets (on which no ground truth exist, I sympathise) you focus on.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SyehoaKh3m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Novelty and performance evaluation are unclear</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1gARiAcFm&amp;noteId=SyehoaKh3m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper945 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">04 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper945 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper describes a NN method called DyMoN for predicting transition vectors between states with a Markov process, and learning dynamics of stochastic systems.

Three biological case studies are presented, it is unclear if any new biology was learned from these cases that we could not have learned using other methods, and how accurate they are. The empirical validations are all on nonbiological data and disconnected from the first part of the paper, making the main application/advantage of this method confusing.

I agree with the computational advantages mentioned in the paper, however, interpretation of the representational aspect is challenging especially in the context of biological systems. Regarding denoising, what are the guarantees that this approach does now remove real biological heterogeneity? Also, a denoising method (MAGIC) was still used to preprocess the data prior to DyMon, there is no discussion about any contradictory assumptions.

Overall, the main shortcoming of the paper is lack of performance evaluation, comparison to other methods and clarifying advantages or novel results over other methods. The description of the method could also be improved and clarified with presenting an algorithm.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJl9Nkl5h7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a> The paper details about a feed-forward NN, called DyMoN, used to model dynamic features of objects that are at multiple phases of transition.

&gt; Even though the paper details the underlying Markovian setup in Section 2, it is unclear to the reader how this knits with the FFNN architecture, for example what are the Markovian functions at hidden layer and output layer. Are they all conditional probabilities? How do you prove that this is what occurs within each node?

&gt; Why is the functional form of f_\theta in Eq 1? 

&gt; How many hidden layers are in place?

&gt; What is the Stochastic dynamical process in Figure A and how is this tethered to DyMon? 

&gt; The authors mention an nth-order Markovian process implemention but is this not the case with any fully connected neural network implementation? What the reader fails to see is why DyMoN is different to these already-existing architectures.

&gt; In the teapot example, the authors mention a DyMoN architecture. (Page 8). Is this what is used throughout for all the experiments? If yes, why is it generalizable and if not, what is DyMoN’s architecture? You could open the DyMoN box in Figure 10 (1) and explain what DyMoN consists.
 

Section 2 is the crux of the paper and needs more work - explain the math in conjunction to the ‘deep’ architecture, what is the 'deep' architecture and why it is needed at all. Then go on to show/prove that the Markovian processes are indeed being realized.
