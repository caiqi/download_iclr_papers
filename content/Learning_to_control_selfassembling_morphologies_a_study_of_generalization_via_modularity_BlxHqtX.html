In contrast, this paper investigates a modular co-evolution strategy: a collection of primitive agents learns to self-assemble into increasingly complex collectives in order to jointly solve control tasks. Each primitive agent consists of a limb and a neural controller. When two limbs link up, a joint is added between them, and messages are passed between the two neural controllers. Linking is treated as a dynamic action: to solve a task, agents learn how to self-assemble into a joint morphology and a joint neural net. The resulting policies and morphologies are dynamic and modular, which allows them to better generalize to novel test-time environments.

The motivation of the paper is interesting. The project videos are attractive. However there are some issues:
1. The proposed model is specific to the "multi-limb" setting. I don't understand the applicability to other setting. How much generality does the method (or the experiment) have?

2. Comparison to other existing methods is not enough. There are many state-of-the-art RL algorithms, and there should be natural extension to this problem setting. I can not judge whether the proposed methods work better or not.

3. The algorithm is not described in detail. For example, detail of the sensor inputs, action spaces, and the whole algorithm including hyper-parameters are not explained well.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HkgwSoPq2Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An interesting idea of dynamical "self-assembly" but unclear implications of the proposed message passing </a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1lxH20qtX&amp;noteId=HkgwSoPq2Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1509 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1509 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper describes training a collection of independent agents enabled with message passing to dynamically form tree-morphologies.  The results are interesting and as proof of concept this is quite an encouraging demonstration.

Main issue is the value of message passing
- Although the standing task does demonstrate that message passing may be of benefit. It is unclear in the other two tasks if it even makes a difference. Is grouping behavior typical in the locomotion task or it is an infrequent event?
  - Would it be correct to assume that even without message passing and given enough training time the "assemblies" will learn to perform as well as with message passing? The graphs in the standing task seem to indicate this. Would you be able to explain and perform experiments that prove or disprove that?
  - The videos demonstrate balancing in the standing task and it is unclear why the bottom-up and bidirectional messages perform equally well. I would disagree with your comment about lack of information for balancing in the top-down messages. The result is not intuitive.
  - Given the above, does message passing lead to a faster training?  Would you be able to add an experimental evidence of this statement?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJlv_HUI2Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting ideas and the setup, but virtually no details provided</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1lxH20qtX&amp;noteId=HJlv_HUI2Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1509 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">31 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1509 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary:
--------------
The paper considers the problem of constructing compositional robotic morphologies that can solve different continuous control tasks in a (multi-agent) reinforcement learning setting. The authors created an environment where the actor consists of a number of primitive components which interface with each other via "linking" and construct a morphology of a robot. To learn in such an environment, the authors proposed a graph neural network policy architecture and showed that it is better than the baselines on the proposed tasks.

I find the idea of learning in environments with modular morphologies as well as the proposed tasks interesting. However, the major drawback of the paper is the lack of any reasonable details on the methods and experiments. It's hard to comment on the novelty of the architecture or the soundness of the method when such details are simply unavailable.

More comments and questions are below. I would not recommend publishing the paper in the current form.


Comments:
----------------
- If I understand it correctly, each component ("limb") represents an agent. Can you define precisely (ie mathematically) what the observations and actions of each agent are?

- Page 4, paragraph 2: in the inline equation, you write that a sum over actions equals policy applied to a sum over states. What does it mean? My understanding of monolithic agents is that observations and actions must be stacked together. Otherwise, the information would be lost.

- Page 4, paragraphs 3-(end of section): if I understand it correctly, the proposed method looks similar to the problem of "learning to communicate" in a cooperative multi-agent setting. This raises the question, how exactly the proposed architecture is trained? Is it joint learning and joint execution (ie there's a shared policy network, observation and action spaces are shared, etc), or not? All the details on how to apply RL to the proposed setup are completely omitted.

- Is the topology of the sub-agents restricted to a tree? Why so? How is it selected (in cases when it is not hand-specified)?

- From the videos, it looks like certain behaviors are very unphysical or unrealistic (eg parts jumping around and linking to each other). I'm wondering which kind of simulator was used? How was linking defined (on the simulator level)? It would be nice if such environments with modular morphologies were built using the standard simulators, such as MuJoCo, Bullet, etc.


All in all, despite potentially interesting ideas and setup, the paper is sloppily written, has mistakes, and lacks crucial details.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: Clear rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HyxDkjCwjm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Some deep issues with your results</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1lxH20qtX&amp;noteId=HyxDkjCwjm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">20 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1509 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Dear authors,

Thanks for working on this problem which always takes us back to the classic Karl Sims results. But it seems like there are two very blatant issues in your experiments: 

1.  There are no details on how you picked the fixed morphology for PPO. You have shown really bad training curves for the locomotion task, but it is quite well known now that any reasonable morphology can be trained to locomote when there are no bugs in the implementation of PPO. So, it seems like the fixed morphology was picked to make sure the baseline doesn't work. 

2. It seems like in most of your experiments the message-passing doesn't matter at all, ie no-message passing baseline works pretty well. So, if all these individual limbs can just independently work to locomote efficiently, the need for the whole DGN architecture is quite questionable. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_ryxNdJrpiQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Authors' response to comments</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1lxH20qtX&amp;noteId=ryxNdJrpiQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1509 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">24 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1509 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">We thank you for taking the time to read our draft. Our answers are as follows:

1. "Fixed-Morphology Baseline"
=&gt; For the fixed-morphology baseline, we chose the morphology to be a straight line chain of 6-limbs (i.e., a linear morphology) in all the experiments including standing-up and locomotion. This linear-chain may be optimal for standing as tall as possible, but it is not necessarily optimal for learning to stand; same would hold for locomotion.

=&gt; Note that DGN also converges to linear-chain morphology to achieve the best reward in case of standing-up task (e.g., see video results on the project website). Moreover, one can confirm that the locomotion task is also solvable with linear-morphology because one of the DGN ablation methods converged to a linear-morphology while doing well at locomotion.

=&gt; The underlying PPO code is used off-the-shelf from a publicly available implementation (<a href="https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr)</a> and is kept same across all methods in the graph without any change.

=&gt; That being said, we were indeed surprised at baseline not performing too well and had been working on improving it. We recently found that it is hard to train fixed-morphology baseline for 6-limbs while it works well with 4-limbs. However, in either case, it does not seem to generalize as well. We will include these latest findings in an updated draft of the paper.

2. "Role of Message-passing in DGN"
=&gt; We would like to emphasize that the message-passing DGN works significantly better than the non-message passing variant in the standing-up task. For instance, there is a significant gap between blue-curve (message passing) and gray-curve (non-message passing) in Figure-1.

=&gt; For the locomotion task, in particular, the graphs do indicate that the message-passing does not improve the performance. We investigated this issue in depth and found out that it is possible to do well on the current bumpy-terrain-locomotion task without making any complicated morphology. For instance, any morphology with sufficient height and forward velocity can make comparable progress. We are running experiments by making the terrain even harder to verify indeed whether it is easiness of the task or the overhead of message-passing that makes non-message passing DGN work as well or better in this case.

3. Other Clarification:
=&gt; Finally, we would like to clarify that the generalization curves denote the performance of different training checkpoints of a model across novel setups without any further fine-tuning on those setups (i.e., zero-shot). Hence, the checkpoint, which performs the best at training, is the one that matters the most in generalization plots instead of the whole x-axis. An alternate and cleaner way to present these generalization results would be to show scores in a table for the best training checkpoint. 

Hope this clarifies the raised questions. We would update the submitted version as the rebuttal period starts with these clarifications and new results.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
