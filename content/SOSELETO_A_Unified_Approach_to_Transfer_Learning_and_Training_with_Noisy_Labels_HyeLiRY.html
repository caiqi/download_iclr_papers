SOSELETO is based on the following simple intuition: some source examples are more informative than others for the target problem.  To capture this intuition, source samples are each given weights; these weights are solved for jointly with the source and target classification problems via a bilevel optimization scheme.  The target therefore gets to choose the source samples which are most informative for its own classification task.  Furthermore, the bilevel nature of the optimization acts as a kind of regularization on the target, mitigating overfitting.  SOSELETO may be applied to both classic transfer learning, as well as the problem of training on datasets with noisy labels; we show state of the art results on both of these problems.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">transfer learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Learning with limited training data by exploiting "helpful" instances from a rich data source.  </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1gW0QzC37" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting approach to transfer learning, although the experimental section could have been clearer</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hye-LiR5Y7&amp;noteId=H1gW0QzC37"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper149 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper149 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">PROS:
* This is an interesting approach of assigning contribution weights to each source sample.
* Could be very helpful for tasks where we have a noisy and a (small) clean dataset.
* The method seems to be performing well for the tasks chosen, especially for the CIFAR experiments.
* Simple idea and relatively easy to implement

CONS:
* Clarity could be improved, especially in the experimental section
* The motivation for the SVHN 0-4 to MNIST 5-9 is not clear. It would make more sense to me to transfer between SVHN 0-5 to SVHN 5-9, or from the entire SVHN to the entire MNIST, but this particular transfer seems somewhat irrelevant to the claims. The two domains are particularly dissimilar and trying to select "good" SVHN samples according to 20 or 25 MNIST samples seems somewhat ill-posed. It is also particularly surprising to me that 25 MNIST samples were enough to train a LeNet to the point of 84% accuracy on the entire MNIST test set. (I'm referring to the target-only line) Is that really the case, or was a larger training set used for that particular line?
* There is a claim that "SOSELETO has superior performance to all of the techniqiues which do not use unlabelled data", however I'm not sure whether these techniques were used as prescribed and if the comparison was fair. For example, I believe domain adaptation techniques like DANN, largely assume a common label space between the domains.
* Comparison with previous re-weighting techniques would have been very informative.

QUALITY:
* The quality of the writing was overall high, with a few exceptions, including the related work and the experimental section.
* In related work, the "bilevel optimization" section could be a bit more descriptive, maybe some of the explanationgiven in Sect. 3 could be moved here?
* The experiments were convincing, with the exception of the SVHN to MNIST section.

CLARITY:
* I believe a better synthetic experiment could be chosen to highlight the approach: how about a truly noisy dataset that is not as separable as the "noisy" dataset in Figure 1? Maybe you could have the same noisy dataset but with a small portion of random points having the wrong label. For the same experiment, it should be clearly stated that your task is binary classification and what was the classifier used.
* For the CIFAR experiments, it is very good that it performs well, but it'd be informative to see if SOSELETO can perform even better with 10K samples.
* It wasn't clear to me whether the a-values of only one batch (32 samples?) at a time were affected. If so, how does this scale to really large datasets like, say, Imagenet?
* In the CIFAR experiments, it is mentioned that a target batch-size is chosen to be larger to enable more a-values to be affected. This seems like a typo, but it was confusing. (I assume that the source batch-size is chosen to be larger)
* Figure 2 could use a better caption and a legend. It would also be an easier figure to parse if the x-axis was reversed (eg. if the x-axis was the fraction of data used)
* It was not clear to me what "true transfer learning" means as opposed to domain adaptation.

ORIGINALITY:
* It seems that this idea has been explored before, however I'm not personally familiar with that work. I would have definitely liked to see comparisons with it though.


SIGNIFICANCE:
* This is a simple idea that seems to work well. As I wrote above, it would be great to know how it compares to other re-weighting techniques.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SJxl2E_9nX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interpretation needed for the weights</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hye-LiR5Y7&amp;noteId=SJxl2E_9nX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper149 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper149 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This is an interesting paper claiming that on assumptions are made (or explicitly made) on the similarity of distributions. Traditionally, we learned the weights for transfer learning by matching the distributions. I am wondering if there are any relationships between those two methods. It is necessary to show the differences between the weighted source domain and the target domain, and compare them with the traditional matching methods.

My another concern is about the technical contribution. The model is very intuitive and simple. Some analyses are made for optimization. However, theoretical justifications are lacking, making the technical contribution weak and looks like a simple combination of two existing techniques. I would like to know if the weights are identifiable and what kinds of weights are preferred. 

By searching, I found related papers on transfer learning with label noise and learning with label noise by importance reweighting, e.g., Yu, Xiyu, et al. "Transfer Learning with Label Noise." arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.09724 (2017). and Liu, Tongliang, and Dacheng Tao. "Classification with noisy labels by importance reweighting." IEEE Transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence 38.3 (2016): 447-461. However, they are not discussed in the submission. It is curious to see the relationships and differences.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rygGGGMu3Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Review</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hye-LiR5Y7&amp;noteId=rygGGGMu3Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper149 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper149 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">In this paper, the authors propose a SOSELETO (source selection for target optimization) framework to transfer learning and training with noisy labels. The intuition is some source instances are more informative than the others. Specifically, source instances are weighted and the weights are learned in a bilevel optimization scheme. Experimental studies on both training with noisy label problems and transfer learning problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SOSELETO.

Overall, this paper is well-written, and easy to follow. The intuition is clear and reasonable, although it is not new. Regarding the technical section, I have the following comments:
(1)	The paper assumes that the source and target domains share the same feature representation parameters \theta. This is a widely used assumption in the existing works. However, these works usually have a specific part to align two domains to support the assumption, e.g. adversarial loss or MMD. In objective of SOSELETO, I do not see such a domain alignment part. I am wondering whether the assumption is still valid in this case. From the experimental study, I find SOSELETO achieves very good results in transfer learning problems. I am wondering whether the performance would be further improved if a domain alignment objective is added in the weighted source loss.
(2)	Each source has a weight, and thus there are n^s \alpha. As mini-batch is used in the training, I am wondering whether batches are overlapping or not. If overlapping, how to decide the final \alpha_i for x^s_i as you may obtain several \alpha_i in batches. 
(3)	Another point is abouth \lambda_p. In the contents, you omit the last term Q \alpha_m \lambda_p in eq.(4) as you use the fact that it is very small. I am not convincing on this omission as \lambda_p is also a weight for the entire derivative. Moreover, if \lambda_p is very small, the convergence would be very slow. In the experimental studies, you use different \lambda_p for different problems. Then, whatâ€™s the rule of setting \lambda_p given a new problem?

Regarding the experimental results, the experimental settings for the section 4.2 are not very clear to me. You may need to clearly state the train and test set (e.g. data size) for each method.
