However is not  always trivial to know if an auxiliary task will be helpful for the main task and when it could start  hurting.  We explore using gradient cosine similarity as an adaptive  weight for the  auxiliary loss, and demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithm in a few domains,  including multi-task supervised learning using subsets of ImageNet, and reinforcement learning using Atari games.  Additionally, we show that our approach is guaranteed to converge to critical points of the main task. This is not guaranteed otherwise, and in principle adding a mis-matched auxiliary loss can lead to divergence on the main task.

Auxiliary task is used for the sole purpose of helping the main one. In other words, auxiliary task performance is not of interest. The simple and sensible approach proposed in the paper is using cosine similarity between the gradients of two loss functions and incorporating the auxiliary one if it is positively aligned with the main gradient. Authors suggest to further scale loss functions using the cosine similarity but it only experiments with the simpler case of binary decision of using both gradients or only the main one. Authors provide a convergence guarantee (without any convergence rate) by simply extending the convergence of gradient method.

The paper is definitely addressing an important problem as the authors cite many previous work which uses the setup of set of auxiliary tasks helping a main one. The method is simple and easy to implement. Hence, it has a potential to be useful for the community.

One major issue for me is the experimental setup. The authors cite many interesting, realistic and practical setups (Zhang et al., 2016; Jaderberg et al., 2017; Mirowski et al., 2017; Papoudakis et al., 2018), but do not use any of these setups in their experiments. Instead, paper uses set of toy experiments. This is very puzzling to me as all these papers set existing baselines for interesting problems which authors can easily compare. I think the paper needs to be experimented and compared with these established methods.

Another major issue is the weak multi-task learning baseline used in the paper. There have been many interesting developments in adaptive scaling of multiple loss functions in the literature. However, paper does not compare with them. Example of these methods are: [GradNorm: Gradient Normalization for Adaptive Loss Balancing in Deep Multitask Networks, ICML 2018] and [Multi-Task Learning Using Uncertainty to Weigh Losses for Scene Geometry and Semantics, CVPR 2018]. Although these methods addresses the case of all tasks being important, it is a valid baseline and need to be compared. Similar to my first points, these papers also use very realistic and interesting experiments which would fit better than the toy experiments in the paper.

Final major issue is the fact that experimental results are suggesting the method is not effective. In ImageNet experiment, auxiliary tasks actually hurt the final performance as the single task is better than all methods including the proposed one. Proposed method does not guarantee that auxiliary tasks will have no harm. The GridWorld experiment is sort of a sanity check to me as it is very hand-crafted. For Breakout experiment, single task actually outperforms all baselines and this means the proposed method results in a harm similar to ImageNet case. For Breakout+MSPacMan experiment, multi task and the proposed method performs almost exactly same. I do not get why the performance on Breakout is relevant for this case since it is not a main task. The paper clearly states that only performance of an interest is the main one which is MSPacMan in this case. Also, in this experiment clearly all methods are still learning as the curve did not plateau yet. I am curious, why the learning is stop there. I do not think we need the method to be effective to be published; but, the negative result should be explained properly.

MINOR NITPICKS
- Algorithm 1&amp;2 are crucial to understand the paper, they should be in main text
- ImageNet class IDs change between years. So, actual wordnet IDs or class names is a better thing to state
- What happens if there are multiple auxiliary tasks?
- Does the theory still hold for loss functions which are not Lipschitz as the Cauchy's gradient method requires that for convergence
In summary, the paper is proposing a sensible method for an important problem. However, it is only tested for toy problems although there are interesting existing setups which would be ideal for the method to be tested. Moreover, it is only compared with the most-naive multi task learning baselines. Even this limited experimental setup does not confirm what the paper is claiming (using auxiliary tasks only when they help). And the paper fails to explain this failure cases. The method needs to be experimented with a more realistic setup with more realistic baselines.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BklWUQ1OhX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Used grandent similarity to decide whether an auxiliary task is useful or hurting the main task.

The proposed cosine simiarity based soft gradient update scheme seems reasonable. The author(s) also experiment the proposed method on three tasks, one supervised learning image classification task, two reinforcement learning tasks, and show improved results respectively.

The paper is in generally well-written. However it would be great if the concerns below could be addressed or discussed in the paper.

1) The proposed method is based on the intuition: if the gradients of the target and auxiliary loss are in the same direction, the auxiliary loss will help the main/target task. Some examples are showed in the paper to support this argument, however it would be helpful if there is some theoritical gurantee on this. So a more general question would be: rather than define the similarity measure to measure the gradient similarity of the target and auxiliary loss, it would be more useful to try to learn or define whether the auxiliary task is good for the target task beforehand.

2) In proposition 1, if the concerns in 1) are reasonable, the equation would be doubtful. For example, one can simply try (g(target task)-g(auxiliary task)) in the equation. Besides, more similarity metrics are expected to be compared here to show why cosine is the optimal choice. For example, L2.

3) Too much content is embedded in appendix, for example, it would be helpful to move the two algorithms or at least discussed the two variants of the gradient updates in the experimental section. Since it is not clear to me whether hard cosine mixing or soft cosine mixing is used to produce the results in the image classification task.

4) In the image classification task, a quantitative analysis would be more convincing since the semantics of the near and far is really hard to define. Even the authors can show a vague definition, it will be helpful. In figure 2b), why the cosine method performs worse compared the other methods before 5000 in x-axis? Is this because of the noise of the gradient? Plus, what is the optimizer used in this experiment?

5) In the first reinforcement learning task, since cosine similarity is the only method used to measure the similarity between auxiliary task and the target task, it would be useful to show the comparison among other task relatedness method in reinforcement learning. For 'This is expected as the noise in the gradients make it hard to measure if the two tasks are a good fit or not',  why is this? Since cosine similarity would be zero if the two tasks are not good fit.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Bklbw0cw2X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Simple method for using gradient information of auxiliary task when it agrees with gradient of main task</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1gl7hC5Km&amp;noteId=Bklbw0cw2X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1324 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1324 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper proposes a method for using auxiliary tasks to support the optimization with respect to a main task. In particular, the method assumes the existence of a loss function for the main task that we are interested in, and a loss function for an auxiliary task that shares at least some of the parameters with the main loss function. When optimizing for the main loss function, the gradient of the auxiliary loss function is also used to update the shared parameters in cases of high cosine similarity with the main task. The method is demonstrated on image classification and a few reinforcement learning settings.

The idea of the paper is simple, and the method has a nice property of (if ignoring some caveats) guaranteeing steps that are directionally correct with respect to the main task. In that sense it is useful in practice, as it limits the potential damage the auxiliary task does to the optimization of the main task.

As the authors also note, the method suffers from some drawbacks. Although the method limits the negative effect of the auxiliary task on the optimization of the main loss function, it can still slow down optimization if the auxiliary task is not well chosen. In that sense, the method is no silver bullet. In addition, the method seems fairly computationally expensive (it would be interesting to understand how much it slows down an update, I would assume the added complexity is roughly a constant multiplier). However, as an alternative to naively adding an auxiliary task, the proposed method is a welcome addition to the tool box of practitioners.

Although the experiments presented in the paper are quite different from each other, I would have wished for even more experiments. The reason is that as the method does not guarantee faster convergence, its applicability is mainly an empirical question. Especially experiments where auxiliary tasks have been used before would be interesting to test with the only addition being introducing the method proposed.

The paper is generally well written and the results are fairly clearly presented. As a minor comment, the authors might want to check that articles (such as "the") are not missing in the text.

All in all, the main merit of the proposed method is its conceptual simplicity and easy to understand value in practical applications where an auxiliary loss function is available. The method also seems to work well enough in the experiments presented.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
