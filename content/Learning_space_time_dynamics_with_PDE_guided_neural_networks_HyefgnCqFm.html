Generally, differential equations are used to describe these processes. In this work, we address the problem of learning spatio-temporal dynamics with neural networks when only partial information on the system's state is available. Taking inspiration from the dynamical system approach, we outline a general framework in which complex dynamics generated by families of differential equations  can be learned in a principled way. Two models are derived from this framework. We demonstrate how they can be applied in practice by considering the problem of forecasting fluid flows. We show how the underlying equations fit into our formalism and evaluate our method by comparing with standard baselines.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">deep learning, spatio-temporal dynamics, physical processes, differential equations, dynamical systems</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SkeVKA1C27" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Review of "Learning space time dynamics with PDE guided neural networks"</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyefgnCqFm&amp;noteId=SkeVKA1C27"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1054 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1054 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">I very much like the aim of this work. This is a problem of interest to a wide community, which as far as I'm aware hasn't yet had much focus from the deep learning community. However, perhaps in part because of this, the paper reads as naive in places. Pages 1-4 are all background saying nothing new, but ignoring the effort made on this problem by other communities. There has been some work done o this problem within statistics, and within the Gaussian process community, to which no reference is made at all by the paper.

There are two novelties as far as I can see (these may or may not be novel - but they were novel to me). The first is use of NNs to model the system. The second is the multiple state restimation (MRSE) on page 5. I struggled to get a feeling about how successful these two aspects of the work are. The results section is difficult to follow, and doesn't compare the method to existing methods and so there is no baseline to say that this is successful or not. Thus I find it hard to judge the execution of the idea. What I really want to know reading a paper like this is should I use this approach? Because there is no comparison to existing methods, it leaves me unsure.

Other comments:
- Is the title correct? I don't see how these are PDE guided NNs? You've used data from a PDE to train the network and as a test problem. A PDE guided NN would, for me, know something about the dynamics (compare with recently work in the GP community where kernels are derived that lead to GPs that analytically obey simple PDEs). 
- There is an obvious link to work in the uncertainty quantification community, particularly around the use of multi-fidelity/ multi-level simulation. This paper is likely to be of interest to them and the link could be more explicit.
- Page 3, after eq 2 - there is notation used here that is undefined Y_{t-k}^t
- The simplifying assumption on page 3 is very strong and unlikely to hold for many systems. But it isn't clear to me whether this is necessary or not? Presumably if it doesn't hold then we may still get an approximation that could be useful, but it is just that we lose any guarantee the method will work.
- I thought the MSRE idea was interesting. It wasn't very well explained or motivated, and it was unclear to me whether it works well or not from the results, or whether it is novel to this paper or not. But I'd like to have read more about it.
- Is the trick in Section 8.2 original to this paper? If so, it seems a nice idea (I've not checked the detail). 
- Most of section 8.1 strikes me as unnecessary.
- There are quite a few typos. In particular, words such as Markovian, Newtonian should be capitalised.

+ The experiments on Euler's equation are slightly better than ResNet for 30 steps ahead forecasting in terms of MSE
+ The paper is clearly written and well-explained

- The model is not new: ResNet for state evolution and  Conv-Deconv for state-observation mapping
- The difference between ResNet and the proposed framework is not significant, ResNet is even better in Figure 2
- Missing an important experiment:  test whether the model can generalize, that is to forecast on different initial conditions than the training dataset
- How does the model compare with GANs (Y. Xie* , E. Franz* and M. Chu* and N. Thuereyy, “tempoGAN: A Temporally Coherent, Volumetric GAN for Super-resolution Fluid Flow”)?

Ignore the score for now, I'll change once I get a clearer picture of what's happening here.

The network you propose in this paper is motivated by solving PDEs where, as in (1), the actual solution as they are computed numerically depends on the current spatial field of the state, as well as difference operators over this field (e.g., both the gradients and the Laplacian terms).  So, I naturally was assuming that you'd be designing a network that actually represented state as a spatial field, and used these difference operators in computing the next state.  But instead, it seems like you reverted to the notion of "because difference operators can be expressed as convolutions, we use a convolutional network", and I don't really see anything specific to PDEs thereafter, just general statements about state-space models.

Am I understanding this correctly?  Why not just actually use the PDE-based terms in the dynamics model of an architecture?  Why bother with a generic ResNet? (And I presume you're using a fully convolutional ResNet here?)  Wouldn't the former work much better, and be a significantly more interesting contribution that just applying a ResNet and a generic U-Net as a state estimator?  I'm not understanding why the current proposed architecture (assuming I understand it correctly) could be seen as "PDE guided" in all but the loosest possible sense.  Can you correct me if I'm misunderstanding some element here?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
