This requires the high-level semantic features should be alike among samples, despite a wide span in resolution, texture, deformation, etc. Previous works focus on re-designing the loss function or proposing new regularization constraints on the loss. In this paper, we address this problem via a new perspective. For each category, it is assumed that there are two sets in the feature space: one with more reliable information and the other with less reliable source. We argue that the reliable set could guide the feature learning of the less reliable set during training - in spirit of student mimicking teacher’s behavior and thus pushing towards a more compact class centroid in the high-dimensional space. Such a scheme also benefits the reliable set since samples become more closer within the same category - implying that it is easilier for the classifier to identify. We refer to this mutual learning process as feature intertwiner and embed the spirit into object detection. It is well-known that objects of low resolution are more difficult to detect due to the loss of detailed information during network forward pass. We thus regard objects of high resolution as the reliable set and objects of low resolution as the less reliable set. Specifically, an intertwiner is achieved by minimizing the distribution divergence between two sets. We design a historical buffer to represent all previous samples in the reliable set and utilize them to guide the feature learning of the less reliable set. The design of obtaining an effective feature representation for the reliable set is further investigated, where we introduce the optimal transport (OT) algorithm into the framework. Samples in the less reliable set are better aligned with the reliable set with aid of OT metric. Incorporated with such a plug-and-play intertwiner, we achieve an evident improvement over previous state-of-the-arts on the COCO object detection benchmark.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">feature learning, computer vision, deep learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">A feature intertwiner module to leverage features from one accurate set to help the learning of another less reliable set.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1xxzwg3hQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>performance is good but novelty is limited</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxZJn05YX&amp;noteId=r1xxzwg3hQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper961 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">04 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper961 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper aims to facilitate feature learning in NN models by exploiting more from reliable examples. This is very similar to self-paced learning where the model  learns from the easier samples at first and proceeds to learn from difficult and challenging samples. The authors should discuss their difference with self-paced learning. 

The method is positioned as a general one for feature learning. I do not know the reason why the authors only apply for object detection on a very specific dataset. It is expected to see whether the proposed method is also effective for image classification. 

More datasets for evaluation are needed, even only for the object detection application. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SJehrj89hm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An interesting take on the problem of detecting small objects</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxZJn05YX&amp;noteId=SJehrj89hm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper961 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper961 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">OVERVIEW:
The authors tackle the problem of detecting small/low resolution objects in an image. Their key idea is that detecting bigger objects is an easier task and can be used to guide the detection of smaller objects. This is done using the "Feature Intertwiner"  which consists of two branches, one for the larger objects (more reliable set that is also easier to detect) and one for the smaller objects (less reliable set). The second branch contains a make-up layer learned during training (which acts as the guidance from the more reliable set) that helps compensate details needed for detection. The authors define a class buffer that contains representative elements of object features from the reliable set for every category &amp; scale and an intertwiner loss that computes the L2 loss between the features from the less reliable set &amp; the class buffer. They also use an Optimal Transport procedure with a Sinkhorn divergence loss between object features from both sets. The overall loss of the system is now a sum of the detection loss, the intertwiner loss and the optimal transport loss. They evaluate their model on the COCO Object detection challenge showing state-of-the-art performance. They also provide thorough ablation analysis of various design choices. The qualitative result in Fig.1 showing well clustered features for both high &amp; low resolution objects via t-SNE is a nice touch.

COMMENTS:
Clarity - The paper is well written and easy to follow.
Originality &amp; Significance - The paper tackles an important problem and provides a novel solution. 
Quality - The paper is complete in that it tackles an important problem, provides a novel solution and demonstrates via thorough experiments the improvement achieved using their approach. 

QUESTIONS:
1. The Class Buffer seems very restricted in having a single element per object category per scale to represent all features. The advantage of forcing such a representation is tight clustering in the feature space. But, wouldn't a dictionary approach with multiple elements give more flexibility to the model and learn a richer feature representation at the cost of not-so-good clustering ?
2. Any comment on why you drop performance for couch ? (and baseball bat + bedroll)
3. In Table 4 of Appendix where you compare with more object detection results, I find it interesting that Mask RCNN, updated results has a might higher AP_S (43.5) compared to you (27.2) and everyone else. I was expecting you to be the best under that metric due to the explicit design for small objects. They (MaskRCNN, updated results) are also significantly better than the rest under AP_M but worse under AP_L. Can you explain this behavior ? Is the ResNeXt backbone that much better for small objects ?

This approach is applied to the object detection task and show consistent performance improvements.

pros)
(+) This paper is well-written and easy to follow.
(+) The base idea that divides the learned features into two sets; the reliable feature set and the less reliable one is very interesting and looks novel. Plus, the hypothesis, which is that reliable features can guide the features in the less reliable set is also interesting.
(+) The performance improvements are quite large.
(+) Extensive ablative studies are provided to support the proposed method well.

cons)
(-) The method of obtaining the representative in buffer B is not clearly presented.
(-) The overall training and inference procedure are not clearly presented. 
(-) Some notations and descriptions are vague and confusing.
(-) More than two datasets are necessary to show the effectiveness of the methods

comments)
- What is the higher level feature map P_m? and How did you choose the higher level feature map at the m-th level in option (b) and (c) in Section 3.3.
- What is the meaning of the "past" features in Section 3.2?
- It is better to show the exact architecture of the make-up module and the critic module.
- Can this method apply to the other backbones such as VGG or ResNets without FPN?
- The sentences at the bottom of p.4 starting with "Note that only~" looks ambiguous. 
- f_critic^j may be the j-th element of F_critic, please denote what f_critic^j stands for.

Even if the paper needs to be revised for better readability, I think this paper is above the standard of ICLR because the idea is interesting and novel. Furthermore, the experimental studies are properly designed and well support the main idea. I am leaning toward acceptance, but I would like to see the other reviewers' comments.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
