Although it can be used to model dependencies without regard to positions of sequences, self-attention is seldom applied to non-sequential data. In this work, we propose to learn representations of multi-field categorical data in prediction tasks via self-attention mechanism, where features are orderless but have intrinsic relations over different fields. In most current DNN based models, feature embeddings are simply concatenated for further processing by networks. Instead, by applying self-attention to transform the embeddings, we are able to relate features in different fields and automatically learn representations of their combinations, which are known as the factors of many prevailing linear models. To further improve the effect of feature combination mining, we modify the original self-attention structure by restricting the similarity weight to have at most k non-zero values, which additionally regularizes the model. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of our self-attention model on non-sequential data. Across two click through rate prediction benchmark datasets, i.e., Cretio and Avazu, our model with top-k restricted self-attention achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Compared with the vanilla MLP, the gain by adding self-attention is significantly larger than that by modifying the network structures, which most current works focus on.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Learning Representations, Feature Combinations, Self-Attention</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1x4CIwo27" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Good results, better justification for the novelty needed.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxwW2A5Km&amp;noteId=r1x4CIwo27"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1177 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">04 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1177 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary
The paper proposes to apply self-attention mechanism from (Vaswani et.al.) to the task of click-through rate prediction, which is a task where one has input features which are a concatenation of multiple one-hot vectors (referred to as fields). The paper finds that applying the self-attention mechanism outperforms state of the art approaches for the task on two benchmark datasets. It then proposes a small modification to the self-attention mechanism, retaining only the top-k attentions to sparsify attention, and finds that it leads to marginal improvements.

Strengths
+ The paper is fairly well written, and the contributions are succinctly summarized.
+ The proposed approach appears to get state of the art results on click-through rate prediction.
+ The results contain clear ablations of the approach.

Negatives
1. It is not clear why the skip connection is needed. Especially, using the skip connection the way it is done in Eqn. 4 is a bit odd since we are adding positive quantities to each other, meaning that across multiple rounds, the magnitude of the attended feature will keep increasing. Perhaps this is the reason why performance deteriorates after attending thrice?

2. Calling top-K a regularizer is somewhat misleading as it is a fundamentally different model class, as opposed to a regularizer that imposes a soft constraint on the kind of solutions that should be preferred in our hypothesis class. The current paper does not show with enough clarity if the improvements with top-k are because it is a better model for the data or because it is a better regularizer. One way to do this would be to systematically look at the difference between training and validation losses with and without top-k and show that the difference is smaller when the model is regularized. 
More generally, it would be ideal to show what kind of a constraint the top-k attention places on the hypothesis class of the original model. For example, the dropout paper shows that dropout, in the linear case is equivalent to L2 regularization (in expectation). (*)

3. It would be interesting to report how often there is an overlap in the top k indices chosen across multi-head attentions.

4. What are the relative number of parameters in each of the models for which the results are reported? Are we ensuring that a similar number of parameters are used to report all the results in say, Table. 1.? Also, it would be good to report error bars for the results in Table. 1 since the differences seem to quite small. (*)


Preliminary Evaluation
The paper is a fairly straightforward application of self-attention to the task of click-through rate prediction. The major modeling novelty is in using top-k attentions for the click-through task, the interestingness/ validity of which needs to be demonstrated more clearly to understand if this heuristic might apply to other models and other datasets. Important points for the rebuttal are marked with a (*) above.

The authors apply the self-attention mechanism, a.k.a. transformer, to improve the representations of multi-field categorical features in recommendation systems. Unlike the previous approaches in which multi-field features are simply concatenated, the proposed method more actively combines those features improving the final performance.

Strengths:
+ It is reasonable to apply the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism to the multi-field features as orders of the fields should not matter.
+ The method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks the technical novelty as it does not propose any novel technique. Rather, it simply applies an existing technique to a new type of dataset.
- More extensive analyses on the learned representation would improve the paper.
- As the authors argue, the method can be used upon other existing state-of-the-art networks. Showing the improvement on other methods would improve the paper. Currently, the authors only present improvement on a simple MLP.

Questions:
To apply the self-attention, the embeddings of the field features should be projected in the same space. I wonder if this physically makes sense. I wonder how they are embedded in the features and relate to each other. I would suggest to include some analysis on the features while putting some rows of Table 3 to the appendix since many of these rows are not directly related to the method itself.

Overall, I like the idea of the paper. However, the paper lacks the technical novelty and presents only limited experiments and analysis. I would suggest the authors include more analyses on the learned representations.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Bye_X4Dt2m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Concern of invalid evaluation and a weak contribution</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyxwW2A5Km&amp;noteId=Bye_X4Dt2m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1177 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1177 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Quality: 
- In 4.4, the authors have vigorously explored the space of hyperparameters. However, they do not describe how to determine the hyperparameters, e.g., set aside a validation set from a part of the training set and determine the hyperparameters using this validation set, while the authors split the two datasets into only training and test sets, respectively. Without this procedure, the results may overfit to the test set via repeated experiments. Even though the used datasets are of few-million, this procedure guarantees a minimum requirement for a reliable outcome from the proposed model. I firmly recommend the authors to update their results using a validation set to determine the hyperparameters and then report on the test set. Please describe these experimental details to ensure that the performed experiments are valid.
   
Clarity:
- Overall, the writing can be improved via proof-reading and polishing the sentences. In Introduction section, "there is little work applying..." can be specified or rephrased with "it is underexplored to apply", and "input features are not independent" can be specified on what there are not independent. Moreover, the last two sentences in the second paragraph in the Introduction section is unclear what the authors want to argue: "The combinations in linear models are then made by cross product over different fields. Due to the sparsity problem, the combinations rely on much manual work of domain experts."
- The authors use top-k restriction (Shazeer et al., 2017) to consider sparse relationships among the features. For this reason, have you tried to use the L1 loss on the probability distributions, which are the outputs of softmax function?
- In 4.5, the authors said, they "are in most concern of complementarity." What is the reason for this idea and why not the "relevance"?
- In Table 4, I'm afraid that I don't understand the content (three numbers in parenthesis) of the third column. How does each input x_i or x_j, or a tuple of them get their own CTR?

Originality and significance:
- They apply self-attention to learn multiple categorical features to predict Click-Through-Rate (CTR) with a top-k non-zero similarity weight constraint to adapt to their categorical inputs. Due to this, the scientific contribution to the corresponding community is highly limited to providing empirical results on the CTR task.
- The authors argue that "most of current DNN-based models simply concatenate all feature embeddings"; however, this argument might be an over-simplified statement for the existing models in section 2.
- Similar works can be found but missed to cite: [1] proposes a general framework to self-attention to exploit sequential (time-domain) and parallel (feature-domain) non-locality. [2] learns bilinear attention maps to integrate multimodal inputs using skip-connections and multiple layers on top of the idea of low-rank bilinear pooling.

Pros:
- Strong empirical results on two CTR tasks using the previous works of self-attention and top-k restriction techniques.

Cons:
- This work fairly lacks its originality since the proposing method heavily relies on the two previous works, self-attention and top-k restriction. They apply them to multiple categorical features to estimate CTR; however, their application seems to be monotonic without a novel idea of task-specific adaptation.

Minor comments:
- In Figure 1, "the number of head" -&gt; "the number of heads".
