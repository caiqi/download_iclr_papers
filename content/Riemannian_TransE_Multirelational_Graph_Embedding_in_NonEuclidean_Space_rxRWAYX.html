The problem is to obtain embeddings that are beneficial for tasks with low-dimensional parameters.
This paper proposes a novel framework, called Riemannian TransE for multi-relational graph embedding. 
Our method realizes embedding in non-Euclidean space, where the loss function is based on the distance.
Thus, our model can use a non-Euclidean space that has good compatibility with the data, and achieves good performance with low-dimensional parameters. 
An evaluation on real knowledge base data shows that with an appropriate choice of manifold, our method achieves comparable accuracy in graph completion with low-dimensional parameters.

For this purpose, the paper introduces a variant of TransE that operates on Riemannian manifolds, in particular, Euclidean, Spherical, and Hyperbolic space. This approach is motivated by the results of Nickel &amp; Kiela (2017), who showed tha  Hyperbolic space can provide important advantages for embedding graphs with hierarchical structure.

Hyperbolic and Riemannian embeddings are a promising research area that fits well into ICLR. Extending hyperbolic, and more general, Riemannian embeddings to multi-relational data is an important aspect in this context, as it allows to extend such methods to new applications such as Knowledge Graph Completion. Overall, the paper is written well and mostly good to understand. However, I am concerned about multiple aspects in the current version:

- What is the motivation for using this particular form of translation? In Riemannian manifolds, the analogue of vector addition and subtraction is typically taken as the exponential or logarithmic map (as expm and logm in Euclidean space are exactly vector addition and subtraction). For the spherical and hyperbolic manifold both maps have closed form expressions and are differentiable. It is therefore not clear to me what the advantage of the proposed approach is compared to these standard methods. In any case, it would be important to include them in the experimental results.

- It is also not clear to me whether the benefits of hyperbolic embeddings translate into the setting that is proposed here. The advantage of hyperbolic embeddings is that they impose a hierarchical structure in the latent space. The method proposed in this paper uses then a single (hyperbolic) embedding of entities across all relation types. This implies that there should be a single consistent hierarchy that explains all the links in all relations. This seems unlikely and might explain some of the hyperbolic results. A more detailed discussion and motivation would be important here.

- Regarding the experimental results: Why are the results for HolE and ComplEx so different? As [1,2] showed, both models are identical, and for that reason should get close to identical results. The large differences seem inconsistent with these results. Furthermore it seems that the results reported in this paper do not match previously reported results. What is the reason for these discrepancies?

The proposed model - Riemannian TransE, based on TransE [Bordes et al. 2013] - maps entities to points in a non-Euclidean space, by minimising a loss based on the geodesic distance in such space. This paper is especially interesting, since extends previous approaches - such as Poincare embeddings - to the multi-relational setting. Results look promising on WN11 and FB13, but authors mention results on the more commonly used WN18 and FB15k are less accurate than those obtained by the baselines (without reporting them). It is worth mentioning that WN18 and FB15k were found to be solvable by very simple baselines (e.g. see [1]). Furthermore, authors do not report any finding on the geometry of the learned spaces.

Introduction - Wording is a bit weird sometimes, e.g. what does "evaluating dense matrices or tensors" mean?
Related Work - Likewise, this section was a bit hard to follow. I do not fully get why authors had to use terms like "planet", "launcher", "satellite" etc. for describing mappings between entities and points in a manifold, relations and points in another manifold, and the manifold where the geodesic distances between representations are calculated.
What is the intuition behind this?
Tab. 1 does a great job at summarising existing scoring functions and their space complexity. However, it may be worth noticing that e.g. the inner product used by DistMult is not really a "dissimilarity" between two representations (but rather the opposite). Is the number of parameters the same for Riemannian TransE as for the other methods (including the extra "l" parameters)? If it isn't the comparison may be slightly unfair.

While this work falls into the class of interesting recent approaches for using non-Euclidean spaces for knowledge graph embeddings, I found it very hard to digest (e.g. the first paragraph in Section 3.3). Figure 3 and 4 confused me more than helping me to understand the method. Furthermore, current neural link prediction methods are usually evaluated on FB15k and WN18. In fact, often on the harder variants FB15k-237 and WN18RR. For FB15k and WN18, Riemannian TransE seems to underperform compared to baselines -- even for low embedding dimensions, so I have doubts how useful this method will be to the community and believe further experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR need to be carried out and the clarity of the paper, particularly the figures, needs to be improved. Lastly, I would be curious about how the different Riemannian TransE variants compare to TransE in terms of speed?

Please kindly note that we focus on relation between accuracy and dimensionality, and specifically on performance in LOW dimensionality. 
This is because good performance in LOW dimensionality is an advantage of using non-Euclidean spaces, as shown in [2].
On the other hand, most papers (including the paper you referred) only report the result in the best dimensionality after grid search. This is why we had to do experiments by ourselves.

However, as you suggested, noting that some methods can attain better in other dimensionality (though it might be much higher than in our experiments) might be kinder to readers. We'll add a note about that in the revised version.

Thank you.

For example, in TransD [1], the embedding size is in {20, 50, 80, 100}, and TransD obtains the accuracies of 86.4% and 89.1% on WN11 and FB13 respectively. Another example is about TransE from [2], TransE gets the accuracy of 85.2% only using the embedding size of 20 on WN11, and gets the accuracy of 87.6% using the embedding size of 100 on FB13.

In our context, 200 dimension is TOO HIGH (note that [1] reports the case where m=n=100, i.e. 200 dimensional case). Our results in 64 and 128 dimension are no more than additional information (to observe relation between dimension and accuracy). 
Moreover, we found that in their experiments, they used ADADELTA and RMSProp in [1] and [2], respectively, whereas we used SGD for all Trans-X methods for fair comparison (we should distinguish the problem of model and optimizer), which we think is the reason made difference in results (and we suspect that TransD is very sensitive to hyperparameters, datasets and tasks, for TransD gives good results even in our experiments with some settings such as hit@10 in WN18). 
However, we admit that we overlooked the results of TransE in 20 dimension in [2].
Although one might think that 20 dimension is still high and our method works well in lower than 20 dimension, it is worth while to note the result in [2]. Thank you for your information.
