A pragmatic solution comes from Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which use hardware and software protections to isolate sensitive computations from the untrusted software stack. However, these isolation guarantees come at a price in performance, compared to untrusted alternatives.
This paper initiates the study of high performance execution of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in TEEs by efficiently partitioning DNN computations between trusted and untrusted devices.
Building upon an efficient outsourcing scheme for matrix multiplication, we propose Slalom, a framework that securely delegates execution of all linear layers in a DNN from a TEE (e.g., Intel SGX or Sanctum) to a faster, yet untrusted, co-located processor.
We evaluate Slalom by executing DNNs in an Intel SGX enclave, which selectively delegates work to an untrusted GPU. For two canonical DNNs, VGG16 and MobileNet, we obtain 20x and 6x increases in throughput for verifiable inference, and 11x and 4x for verifiable and private inference.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Trusted hardware, integrity, privacy, secure inference, SGX</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We accelerate secure DNN inference in trusted execution environments (by a factor 4x-20x) by selectively outsourcing the computation of linear layers to a faster yet untrusted co-processor.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rkgtvmXc2m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A nice systems approach to certain ML security problems with good performance</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJVorjCcKQ&amp;noteId=rkgtvmXc2m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper119 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper119 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">In this paper, the authors consider solving three ML security related challenges that would primarily arise
in the cloud based ML model. Namely, they consider the setting where a client wishes to obtain predictions
from an ML model hosted on a server, while being sure that the server is running the model they believe is being run
and without the server learning nothing about their input. Additionally, the server wishes for the user to learn 
nothing about the model other than its output on the user's input. To solve this problem, the authors introduce a
new scheme for running ML algorithms in a trusted execution environment. The key idea is to oursource expensive
computation involved with forwarding images through a model to an untrusted GPU in a way that still allows for
the TEE to verify the integrity of the GPU's output. Because the authors' method is able to utilize GPU computing,
they achieve substantial speed-ups compared to methods that run the full neural network in trusted hardware.

Overall, I found the paper to be very well written and easy to digest, and the basic idea to be simple. The 
authors strike a nice balance between details left to the appendix and the high level overview explained in
the paper. At the same time, the authors' proposed solution seems to achieve reasonably practicable performance
and provides a simple high-throughput solution to some interesting ML security problems that seems readily
applicable in the ML-as-a-cloud-service use case. I only have a few comments and feedback.

I would recommend the authors use the full 10 pages available by moving key results from the appendix to the main
text. At present, much of the experimental evaluation performed is done in the appendix (e.g., Figures 3 through 
5). 

The notation PR_{s \overset{s}{\gets}\mathbb{S}^{n}}[...] is not defined anywhere as far as I can tell
before its first usage in Lemma 2.1. Does this just denote the probability over a uniform random draw of
s from \mathbb{S}? If so, I might recommend just dropping the subscript: A, B, and C being deterministic
makes the sample space unambiguous. "negl(\lambda)" is also undefined. 

In section three you claim that Slalom could be extended to other architectures like residual networks.
Can you give some intuition on how straightforward it would be to implement operations like concatenation
(required for DenseNets)? I would expect these operations could be implemented in the TEE rather than 
on the coprocessor and then verified. However, the basic picture on the left of Figure 1 may then change,
as the output of each layer may need to be verified before concatenation? I think augmenting the right
of Figure 1 to account for these operations may be straightforward. It would be interesting to see
throughput results on these networks, particularly because they are known to substantially outperform
VGG in terms of classification performance.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1eyl4tHhQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Overall solid paper, would be stronger if it included a discussion of limitations of the approach</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJVorjCcKQ&amp;noteId=r1eyl4tHhQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper119 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">30 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper119 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors propose a new method of securely evaluating neural networks. The approach builds upon existing Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), a combination of hardware and software that isolates sensitive computations from the untrusted software stack. The downside of TEE is that it is expensive and slow to run. This paper proposes outsourcing the linear evaluation portions of the DNN to an untrusted stack that's co-located with the TEE. To achieve privacy (i.e., the input isn't revealed to the untrusted evaluator), the approach adds a random number r to the input vector x, evaluates f(x+r) on the untrusted stack, then subtracts off f(r) from the output. This limits the approach to be applicable to only linear functions. To achieve integrity (verify the correctness of the output), the paper proposes testing with random input vectors (an application of Freivalds theorem, which bounds the error probability). The techniques for integrity and privacy works only on integer evaluations, hence the network weights and inputs need to be quantized. The paper tries to minimize degradation in accuracy by quantizing as finely as numerically allowable, achieving &lt;0.5% drop in accuracy on two example DNNs. Overall, compared to full evaluation in a TEE, this approach is 10x faster on one DNN, and 40x to 64x faster on another network (depending on how the network is formulated).

Disclaimer: I am a complete outsider to the field of HW security and privacy. The paper is very readable, so I think I understand its overall gist. I found the approach to be novel and the results convincing, though I may be missing important context since I'm not familiar with the subject.

To me, the biggest missing piece is a discussion of the limitations of the approach. How big of a network can be evaluated this way? Is it sufficient for most common applications? What are the bottlenecks to scaling this approach?

It's also not clear why integrity checks are required. Is there a chance that the outsourcing could result in incorrect values? (It's not obvious why it would.)

Lastly, a question about quantization. You try to quantize as finely as possible (to minimize quantization errors) by multiplying by the largest power of 2 possible without causing overflow. Since quantization need to be applied to both input and network weights, does this mean that you must also bound the scale of the input? Or do you assume that the inputs are pre-processed to be within a known scale? Is this possible for intermediate outputs (i.e., after the input has been multiplied through a few layers of the DNN)?

Pros:
- Simple yet effective approach to achieve the goals laid out in the problem statement
- Clearly written
- Thorough experiments and benchmarks
- Strong results

Cons:
- No discussion of limitations
- Minor questions regarding quantization and size limits

Given the growing interest in building trust worthy and privacy protecting AI systems, this paper demonstrates a novel approach to achieve these important goals by allowing a trusted, but slow, computation engine to leverage a fast but untrusted computation engine. For the sake of protecting privacy, this is done by establishing an additive secret share such that evaluation on one part of the share is performed offline and the computation on the other part of the share is performed on the untrusted engine. To verify the correctness of the computation on the untrusted server, a randomized algorithm is used to sample the correctness of the results. Using these techniques, the authors demonstrate an order of magnitude speedup compared to running only on the trusted engine and 3-4 orders of magnitude speedup compared to software-based solutions.

Overall this is a strong paper which presents good ideas that have influence in ML and beyond. I appreciate the fact that the authors are planning to make their code publicly available which makes it more reproducible. Below are a few comments/questions/suggestions 

1.	This papers, and other papers too, propose mechanisms to protect the privacy of the data while outsourcing the computation on a prediction task. However, an alternative approach would be to bring the computation to the data, which means performing the prediction on the client side. In what sense is it better to outsource the computation? Note that outsourcing the computation requires both complexity on the server side and additional computation on the client side (encryption &amp; decryption).
2.	You present the limitations of the trust model of SGX only in the appendix while in the paper you compare to other techniques such as Gazzelle which have a different trust model and assumption. It makes sense to, at least, hint the reader on these differences. 
3.	In section 2.2: “has to be processed with high throughput when available” is it high throughput that is required or low latency?
4.	In Section 4.3: in one of the VGG experiment you computed only the convolution layers which, as you say, are commonly used to generate features. In this case, however, doesn’t it make more sense that the feature generation will take place on the client side while only the upper layers (dense layers) will be outsourced?
5.	In section 4.3 “Private Inference” : do you include in the time reported also the offline preprocessing time? As far as I understand this should take the same amount of time as computing on the TEE.
