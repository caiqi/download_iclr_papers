Generating an image through a neural network is like ``dreaming'', which is fundamentally different from how humans create artwork using brushes. To imitate human drawing, interactions between the agent and the environment is required to allow trials from the agent. However, the environment is usually non-differentiable, leading to slow convergence and massive computation. In this paper we try to address the discrete nature of software environment with an intermediate, differentiable simulation, which can be interpreted as a neural perception of the surroundings of the upper agent. We present StrokeNet, a novel model where the agent is trained upon a well-crafted neural approximation of the painting environment. With this approach, our agent was able to learn to write characters such as MNIST digits very quickly in an unsupervised manner. Our primary contribution is the neural simulation of real-world environment. Furthermore, the agent trained with our approach can be directly transferred to real world with learned skills. To the best of our knowledge, StrokeNet is the first model to apply differentiable simulation to real-world learning problems and standard datasets.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">image generation, differentiable model, reinforcement learning, deep learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">StrokeNet is a novel architecture where the agent is trained to draw by strokes on a differentiable simulation of the environment, which could effectively exploit the power of back-propagation.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Hyg0dv2n2Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Review</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJxwDiActX&amp;noteId=Hyg0dv2n2Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper270 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper270 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper deals with the problem of strokes-based image generation (in contrast to raster-based). The authors define strokes as a list of coordinates and pressure values along with the color and brush radius of a stroke. Then the authors investigate whether an agent can learn to produce the stroke corresponding to a given target image. The authors show that they were able to do so for the MNIST and OMNIGLOT datasets. This is done by first training an encoder-decoder pair of neural networks where the latent variable is the stroke, and the encoder and decoder have specific structure which takes advantage of the known stroke structure of the latent variable.

The paper contains no quantitative evaluation, either with existing methods or with any baselines. No ablations are conducted to understand which techniques provide value and which don't. The paper does present some qualitative examples of rendered strokes but it's not clear whether these are from the training set or an unseen test set. It's not clear whether the model is generalizing or not.

The writing is also very unclear. I had to fill in the blanks a lot. It isn't clear what the objective of the paper is. Why are we generating strokes? What use is the software for rendering images from strokes? Is it differentiable? Apparently not. The authors talk about differentiable rendering engines, but ultimately we learn that a learnt neural network decoder is the differentiable renderer.

To improve this paper and make it acceptable, I recommend the following:

1. Improve the presentation so that it's very clear what's being contributed. Instead of writing the chronological story of what you did, instead you should explain the problem, explain why current solutions are lacking, and then present your own solutions, and then quantify the improvements from your solution.

2. Avoid casual language such as "Reason may be", "The agent is just a plain", "since neural nets are famouse for their ability to approximate all sorts of functions".

3. Show that strokes-based generation enables capabilities that raster-based generation doesn't. For instance, you could show that the agent is able to systematically generalize to very different types of images. I'd also recommend presenting results on datasets more complex than MNIST and OMNIGLOT.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1x_SWqKn7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Review of "StrokeNet: A Neural Painting Environment"</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJxwDiActX&amp;noteId=H1x_SWqKn7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper270 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper270 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary: they propose a differentiable learning algorithm that can output a brush stroke that can approximate a pixel image input, such as MNIST or Omniglot. Unlike sketch-pix2seq[3] (which is a pixel input -&gt; sketch output model based on sketch-rnn[2]), their method trains in an unsupervised manner and does not require paired image/stroke data. They do this via training a "world model" to approximate brush painting software and emulate it. Since this emulation model is differentiable, they can easily train an algorithm to output a stroke to approximate the drawing via back propagation, and avoid using RL and costly compute such in earlier works such as [1].

The main strength of this paper is the original thought that went into it. From reading the paper, my guess is the authors came from a background that is not pure ML research (for instance, they are experts in Javascript, WebGL, and their writing style is easy to read), and it's great to see new ideas into our field. While research from big labs [1] have the advantage of having access to massive compute so that they can run large scale RL experiments to train an agent to "sketch" something that looks like MNIST or Omniglot, the authors probably had limited resources, and had to be more creative to come up with a solution to do the same thing that trains in a couple of hours using a single P40 GPU. Unlike [1] that used an actual software rendering package that is controlled by a stroke-drawing agent, their creative approach here is to train a generator network to learn to approximate a painting package they had built, and then freeze the weights of this generator to efficiently train an agent to draw. The results for MNIST and Omniglot look comparable to [1] but achieved with much fewer resources. I find this work refreshing, and I think it can be potentially much more impactful than [1] since people can actually use it with limited compute resources, and without using RL.

That being said, things are not all rosy, and I feel there are things that need to be done for this work to be ready for publication in a good venue like ICLR. Below are a few of my suggestions that I hope will help the authors improve their work, for either this conference, or if it gets rejected, I encourage the authors to try the next conference with these improvements:

1) multiple strokes, longe strokes. I don't think having a model that can output only a single stroke is scalable to other (simple) datasets such pixel versions of KangiVG [4] or QuickDraw [5]. The authors mentioned the need for an RNN, but couldn't the encoder just output the stroke in a format that contains the pen-down / pen-up event, like the stroke format suggested in [2]? Maybe, maybe not, but in either case, for this work to matter, multiple stroke generation is needed. Most datasets are also longer than 16 points, so you will need to show that your method works for say 80-120 points for this method to be comparable to existing work. If you can't scale up 16 points, would like to see a detailed discussion as to why.

2) While I like this method and approach, to play devil's advocate, what if I simply use an off the shelf bmp-to-svg converter that is fast and efficient (like [6]), and just build a set of stroke data from a dataset of pixel data, and train a sketch-rnn type model described in [3] to convert from pixel to stroke? What does this method offer that my description fails to offer? Would like to see some discussion there.

3) I'll give a hint for as to what I think for (2). I think the value in this method is that it can be converted to a full generative model with latent variables (like a VAE, GAN, sketch-rnn) where you can feed in a random vector (gaussian or uniform), and get a sketch as an output, and do things like interpolate between two sketches. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the encoder here in the first figure outputs an embedding that has a Gaussian prior (like a VAE), so it fails to be a generative model (check out [1], even that is a latent variable model). I think the model can be easily converted to one though to address this issue, and I strongly encourage the authors to try enforcing a Gaussian prior to an embedding space (that can fit right between the 16x16x128 average pooling op to the fully connected 1024 sized layer), and show results where we can interpolate between two latent variables and see how the vector sketches are interpolated. This has also been done in [2]. If the authors need space, I suggest putting the loss diagrams near the end into the appendix, since those are not too interesting to look at.

4) As mentioned earlier, I would love to see experimental results on [4] KangiVG and [5] QuickDraw datasets, even subsets of them. An interesting result would be to compare the stroke order of this algorithm with the natural stroke order for human doodles / Chinese characters.

Minor points:

a) The figures look like they are bitmap, pixel images, but for a paper advocating stroke/vector images, I recommend exporting the diagrams in SVG format and convert them to PDF so they like crisp in the paper.

b) Write style: There are some terms like "huge" dataset that is subjective and relative. While I'm happy about the writing style of this paper, maybe some reviewers who are more academic types might not like it and have a negative bias against this work. If things don't work out this time, I recommend the authors asking some friends who have published (successfully) at good ML conferences to proof read this paper for content and style.

c) It's great to see that the implementation is open sourced, and put it on github. Next time, I recommend uploading it to an anonymous github profile/repo, although personally (and for the record, in case area chairs are looking), I don't mind at all in this case, and I don't think the author's github address revealed any real identity (I haven't tried digging deeper). Some other reviewers / area chairs might not like to see a github link that is not anonymized though.

So in the end, even though I really like this paper, I can only give a score of 6. If the authors are able to address points 1-4, please do what you can in the next few weeks and give it your best shot. I'll look at the paper again and will revise the score upwards by a point or two if I think the improvements are there. If not, and this work ends up getting rejected, please consider improving the work later on and submitting to the next venue. Good luck!

Not yet great about this paper: 
 - the paper feels premature: There is a nice idea, but restricting the drawing environment to be 
 - Some of the choices in the paper are a bit surprising, e.g. the lines in the drawing method are restricted to be at most 16 points long. If you look at real drawing data (e.g. the quickdraw dataset: <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data)</a> you will find that users draw much longer lines typically. 
 - the entire evaluation of this paper is purely qualitative (and that is not quite very convincing either). I feel it would be important for this paper to add some quantitative measure of quality. E.g. train an MNIST recognizer synthesized data and compare that to a recognizer trained on the original MNIST data. 
 - a proper discussion of how the proposed environment is different from the environment proposed by Ganin et al (Deepmind's SPIRAL) 

Minor comments: 
 - abstract: why is it like "dreaming" -&gt; I do agree with the rest of that statement, but I don't see the connection to dreaming
 - abstract: "upper agent" -&gt; is entirely unclear here. 
 - abstract: the footnote at the end of the abstract is at a strange location
 - introduction: and could thus -&gt; and can thus 
 - introduction: second paragraph - it would be good to add some citations to this paragraph. 
 - resulted image-&gt; resulting image
 - the sentence: "We can generate....data is cheap" - is quite unclear to me at this time. Most of it becomes clearer later in the paper - but I feel it would be good to put this into proper context here (or not mention it)
 - we obtained -&gt; we obtain
 - called a generator -&gt; call a generator 
 - the entire last paragraph on the first page is completely unclear to me when reading it here. 
 - equations 1, 2: it's unclear whether coordinates are absolute or relative coordinates. 
- fig 1: it's very confusing that the generator, that is described first is represented at the right. 
 - sec 3.2 - first line: wrong figure reference - you refer to fig 2 - but probably mean fig 1
 - page 3 bottom: by appending the encoded color and radius data we have a feature with shape 64x64xn -&gt; I don't quite see how this is true. The image was 64x64 -&gt; and I don't quite understand why you have a color/radius for each pixel. 
 - sec 3.3 - it seem sthat there is a partial sentence missing 
 - sec 3.4 - is it relevant to the rest of the paper that the web application exists (and how it was implemented). 
 - fig 2 / fig 3: these figures are very hard to read. Maybe inverting the images would help. Also fig 3 has very little value.  </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
