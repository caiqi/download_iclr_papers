To achieve a good trade-off between model size and accuracy, popular compression techniques usually rely on hand-crafted heuristics and
require manually setting the compression ratio of each layer. This process is typically costly and suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Layer Pruning method (MLPrune), which is theoretically sound, and can automatically decide appropriate compression ratios for all layers. Towards this goal, we use an efficient approximation of the Hessian as our pruning criterion, based on a Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several datasets and architectures, outperforming previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. Our experiments show that we can compress AlexNet and VGG16 by 25x without loss in accuracy on ImageNet. Furthermore, our method has much fewer hyper-parameters and requires no expert knowledge.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Automated Model Compression, Neural Network Pruning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">MLPrune: an automated pruning method that doesn't require any tuning for per-layer compression ratio, achieves state-of-the-art pruning results on AlexNet and VGG16.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SJgffqb2h7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Second order method for pruning multiple layers</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1g5b2RcKm&amp;noteId=SJgffqb2h7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1196 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">04 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1196 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes a multi-layer pruning technique based on the Hessian. The main claims are performing better than other second order pruning methods and be principled. 


Main concerns / comments are:
-	Part of the novelty relays on computing the Hessian, and the algorithm goes for very large networks (parameter wise), why? Modern networks do have much fewer parameters and do perform better. How does it behave on those? Would be interesting to see impact on modern networks (e.g., ResNet). 


-	Paper claims to be principled (as many others) and being able to address multiple layers at the same time. I do believe first order methods do that as well. Why not compared to them? 
-	Paper claims little overhead (compared to training and re-training). There is not much on that. Also, following the pipeline [train-prune-retrain] can be substituted by pruning while training with little overhead as in recent papers: (such as Learning with structured sparsity or Learning the number of neurons in DNN both at NIPS2016 or encouraging low-rank at compression aware training of DNN, nips 2017). Compared to those newer methods, this proposal has a drop-in accuracy while those do not. Would be nice to have a discussion related to that. Would be possible to include this into the original training process? 
-	Experiments are shown in small datasets and non-current networks with millions of parameters which do not reflect current state of the art. I would be interested to see limitations in networks not having fully connected layers with the large majority of (redundant) parameters.
-	Compute time is not provided. Please comment on that
-	I am not sure if I understand the statement on 'pruning methods can not handle multiple layers'. To the best of my understanding, current pruning methods as those mentioned above do

-	Different to others, the proposed method, given a desired compression ratio can adjust the relevance of each layer. That is interesting, however, what is the motivation behind? Would be interesting to be able to control specifically each layer to make sure, for instance, the latency of each layer is maintained. 


-	I am confused with \lambda, how does this go from percentage to per parameter? Is that guaranteed?

It firstly pre-trains a network. Then it utilizes K-FAC to approximate the Fisher matrix, which in turn approximates the exact Hessian matrix of training loss w.r.t model weights. The approximated Hessian matrix is then used to estimate the increment of loss after pruning a connection. The connections from all layers with the smallest loss increments are pruned and the network is re-trained to the final model.

Strength:
1. The paper is well-written and clear. 
2. The method is theoretically sound and outperforms state-of-the-art by a large margin in terms of compression ratio. 
3. The analysis of the pruning is interesting.

Weakness:
*Method complexity and efficiency are missing, either theoretically or empirically.* 
The main contribution claimed in the paper is that they avoid the time-consuming search for the compression ratio for each layers. However, there are no evidences that the proposed method can save time. As the authors mention, AlexNet contains roughly 61M parameters. On the other hand, the two matrices A_{l-1} and DS_l needed in the method for a fully-connected layer already have size 81M and 16M respectively. Is this only a minor overhead, especially when the model goes deeper?

Overall, it is a good paper. I am inclined to accept, and I hope that the authors can show the complexity and efficiency of their method.

The idea is inspired by the Optimal Brain Surgeon method, which relies on second derivatives of the loss w.r.t. the network parameters. Here, the corresponding Hessian matrix is approximated using the Fisher information to make the algorithm scalable to very deep networks.

Strengths:
- The method does not require hyper-parameter tuning.
- The results show the good behavior of the approach.

Weaknesses:

Novelty:
- In essence, this method relies on the work of Marten &amp; Grosse to approximate the Hessian matrix used in the Optimal Brain Surgeon strategy. This is fine, but not of great novelty.

Method:
- It is not clear to me why the notion of binary parameters gamma is necessary. Instead of varying the gammas from 1 to 0, why not directly zero out the corresponding network parameters w?
- In essence, the objective function in Eq. 5 adds an L_1 penalty on the gamma parameters, which would be related to an L_1 penalty on the ws. Note that this strategy has been employed in the past, e.g., Collins &amp; Kohli, 2014, "Memory Bounded Deep Convolutional Networks".
- It is not clear to me how zeroing out individual parameters will truly allows one to reduce the model afterwards. In fact, one would rather want to remove entire rows or columns of the matrix W_l, which would truly correspond to a smaller model. This was what was proposed by Wen et al., NIPS 2016 and Alvarez &amp; Salzmann, NIPS 2016, "Learning the Number of Neurons...".
- In the past, when dealing with the Hessian matrix, people have used the so-called Pearlmutter trick (Pearlmutter, Neural Computation 2014, "Fast exact multiplication by the Hessian". In fact, in this paper, the author mentions the application to the Optimal Brain Surgeon strategy. Is there a benefit of the proposed approach over this alternative strategy?

Experiments:
- While the reported compression rates are good, it is not clear to me what they mean in practice, because the proposed algorithm zeroes out individual parameters in the matrix W_l of each layer.  This does not guarantee entire channels to be removed. As such, I would not know how to make the model actually smaller in practice. It would seem relevant to show the true gains in memory usage and in inference speed (both measured on the computer, not theoretically).

Summary:
I do appreciate the fact that the proposed method does not require hyper-parameters and that it seems to yield higher compression rates than other pruning strategies that act on individual parameters. However, novelty of the approach is limited, and I am not convinced of its actual benefits in practice.
