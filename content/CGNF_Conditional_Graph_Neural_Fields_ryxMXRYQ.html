These models could learn a better node representation through encoding the graph structure and node features. However, the correlation between the node labels are not considered. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for graph node classification, named conditional graph neural fields (CGNF). By integrating the conditional random fields (CRF) in the graph convolutional networks, we explicitly model a joint probability of the entire set of node labels, thus taking advantage of neighborhood label information in the node label prediction task. 
Our model could have both the representation capacity of graph neural networks and the prediction power of CRFs. Experiments on several graph datasets demonstrate effectiveness of CGNF.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">graph neural networks, energy models, conditional random fields, label correlation</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Syx6o21R2Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Novelty is incremental.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryxMX2R9YQ&amp;noteId=Syx6o21R2Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1337 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1337 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes a conditional graph neural network to explore the label correlation. In fact, this method combines graph convolutional neural network and CRF together. The novelty is incremental. No new insight is provided toward this topic. 

For experiments, how did you train DeepWalk (Node2vec)? By using all nodes or the selected training set? It should be clarified in the paper. 

Additionally, Table 3 says the result of semi-supervised methods. But how did you conduct semi-supervised learning for DeepWalk or Node2vec?

The idea of the paper is interesting, but the work is not solid enough. Detailed comments come as follows,

1. In the proposed model, the authors treat the pairwise energy as prior and they do not depend on any features. Unlike the usual graph model in Eq (4), the authors further use the normalized \hat A as a scale factor in the pairwise term. What is the intuition for this?

2. The loss (10), which the authors claim that they are using, may not work. In fact, the loss cannot be used to use for training most architectures: ``while this loss will push down on the energy of the desired answer, it will not pull up on any other energy.''(LeCun et. al. 2006, A tutorial on energy-based learning). For deep structured model learning, please using piecewise learning, or joint training using some common CRF loss, such as log-loss. In fact, the authors are not using the energy-based loss as they have constraints on unary and pairwise terms. In fact, if we ignore the pairwise term in (11), the loss becomes log-loss for GCN. With the pairwise term, the loss is somehow like the loss for piecewise learning but the constraints on U is wrong (for piecewise learning, U should sum to 1).

3. The inference procedure is too simple that it can hardly find the near-optimal solutions. In fact, there exists an efficient mean-field based inference algorithm (Shuai Zheng et. al., 2015). Why did the authors choose a simple but poor inference procedure?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SyeJdNZYhm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Reviewer comment</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryxMX2R9YQ&amp;noteId=SyeJdNZYhm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1337 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1337 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposed a combination of graph neural networks and conditional random field to model the correlation between node labels in the output.  In typical graph neural nets the predictions for nodes are conditionally independent given the node representations.  This paper proposes to use a CRF to compensate for that.  In terms of the approach, the authors used GCNs to produce unary potentials for the CRF, and have the pairwise potentials on each edge to model the correlation of labels of neighboring nodes.  Learning is done by optimizing pseudo-likelihood and the energy loss, while inference is performed through a couple heuristic processes.

Combining neural nets with CRFs is not a new idea, in particular this has been tried before on image and sequence CRFs.  It is therefore not surprising to see an attempt to also try it for graph predictions.  The main argument for using a CRF is its ability to model the correlations of output labels which was typically treated as independent.  However this is not the case for deep neural networks, as it already fuses information from all over the input, and therefore for most prediction problems it is fine to be conditionally independent for the output, as the dependence is already modeled in the representations.  This is true for graph neural networks as well, if we have a deep graph neural net, then the GNN itself will take care of most of the dependencies between nodes and produce node representations that are suitable for conditionally independent output predictions.  Therefore Iâ€™m not convinced that CRFs are really necessary for solving the prediction tasks tried in this paper.

The learning and inference algorithms proposed in this paper are also not very convincing.  CRFs has been studied for a long time, and there are many mature algorithms for learning them.  We could do proper maximum conditional likelihood learning, and use belief propagation to estimate the marginals to compute the gradients.  Zheng et al. (2015) did this for convnets, we could also do this for graph CRFs as belief propagation can be easily converted into message passing steps in the graph neural network.  Pseudo-likelihood training makes some sense, but energy loss minimization doesnâ€™t really make sense and has serious known issues.

On the other hand, the proposed inference algorithms does not have good justifications.  Why not use something standard, like belief propagation for inference again?  Our community has studied graphical models a lot in the last decade and we have better algorithms than the ones proposed in this paper.

Lastly, the experiments are done on some standard but small benchmarks, and my personal experience with these datasets are that it is very easy to overfit, and most of the effort will be put in to prevent overfitting.  Therefore more powerful models typically cannot be separated from overly simple models.  I personally donâ€™t care a lot about the results reported on these datasets.  Besides, there are a lot of questions about the proposed model, but all we get from the experiment section are a few numbers on the benchmarks.  I expect studies about this model from more angles.  One more minor thing about the experiment results: the numbers for GraphSAGE are definitely wrong.

Overall I think this paper tackles a potentially interesting problem, but it isnâ€™t yet enough to be published at ICLR due to its problems mentioned above.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
