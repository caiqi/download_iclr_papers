The approximation replaces the rank-4 credit assignment tensor by a reduced-rank product of a sensitivity weight and a temporal sensitivity kernel. In this structured approximation motivated by node perturbation, sensitivity weights and relevant time scales are learned by applying perturbations. The rule represents another step toward biologically plausible or neurally inspired ML, with relaxed architectural requirements (no symmetric return weights), a smaller memory demand (no unfolding and storage of states over time), and a shorter feedback time. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">RNNs, Biologically plausible learning rules, Algorithm, Neural Networks, Supervised Learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">A biologically plausible learning rule for training recurrent neural networks</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1lH3_Ian7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>limited empirical evidence</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryGfnoC5KQ&amp;noteId=B1lH3_Ian7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper691 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper691 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper proposes an alternative to backprop through time for
training RNN models.

The paper is reasonably well written, but somewhat dense and hard
to follow.  The contribution seems novel.

The main issue is the empirical evaluation.  All of the tasks
(masked addition, pixel-by-pixel MNIST, and the AnBn problem)
are artificial.

In addition, the results on some of the tasks are mixed if not
in favor of BPTT.  I am not convinced that these results are enough
to showcase the practical advantages of KeRL.

I am willing to increase my score, if the authors address this
issue.

Detailed comments:

- The authors mention that BPTT is not biologically plausible.  Although
  reasonable, I don't get why this would be an argument against it.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1e45z9n2Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting evidence that extreme approximations to BPTT can work</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryGfnoC5KQ&amp;noteId=B1e45z9n2Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper691 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">04 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper691 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes a simple method for performing temporal credit assignment in RNN training.  While it seems somewhat naive and unlikely to work (in my opinion), the experimental results surprisingly show reasonable performance on several reasonably challenging artificial tasks.

The core of the approach is based on equation 7, which approximates the Jacobian between different hidden states at different time-steps as a single adaptively-learned matrix times a decay factor that depends on the time gap.  While this seems like a very severe approximation to make the authors speculate that some kind of feedback alignment-like mechanism might be at play.

The presentation needs work in several areas, and the experimental results require more explanation, but otherwise this seems like a solid paper.  I would probably increase my rating if the authors could address my issues satisfactorily. 


See below for more detailed comments:

Abstract &amp; Section 1: 

Is "sensitivity tensor" or "credit assignment tensor" common term?  Because I've never heard them before.  Consider defining them before you discuss it, and using consistent jargon.  Later in Section 2 you seem to call this the "RTRL tensor" (whose meaning I can infer).  

Section 2:

Gradient vanishing isn't so much a problem in itself, but a symptom that the sensitivity of the network's output to the action of some neuron in the past is very low. Ths gradient is just relaying this information, so I don't really see vanishing gradients as the problem to overcome, but rather low sensitivity on past activations.

Section 3: 

Did you mean to write (W^out h^t + b^out) instead of (W^out h + b^out)^t ?

"[equation] represents the gradient of the cost with respect to the current hidden state".  The RHS of this equation makes no sense to me.  Not only does this not depend on the nonlinearity in any way, it doesn't include any consideration of future outputs on which the current h surely depends. 

It would make the paper much more pleasant to read if you gave your derivation of the learning rule before you stated it in gory detail.  It feels almost completely arbitrary reading it first without any justification. This might be fine if it were compact and elegant, but it's not.

Consider using exp(x) instead of e^x since the symbol e already means something else in your notation.

Section 4:

Please define "temporal variation"


Section 5:

You should elaborate on the experimental setup you used.  Especially for the Addition and MNIST problems.  For example, what consistutes a "step" in figure 2?  Does KeRL take "one" step per time-step?  Or does "step" mean a complete gradient computation from running from t = 1 to t= T?  Is the BPTT truncated?  Are you counting one step of BPTT to be one complete forwards and backwards pass?

You should include some basic description of what an IRNN is.

When you say that for MNIST that KeRL "does not converge to as good of an optimum" this seems like unjustified inference.  You don't really know that it is converging to a minimum of the original objective at all.  It could be converging to the minimum of some other objective it is implicitly optimizing due to your approximations (if one even exists).  Or it could be simply cycling around and failing to converge.  The fact that the loss plateaus isn't direct evidence of convergence in any sense.  If you wanted to measure this more directly you could look at the (true) gradient magnitude.

"only requires a few tensor operations at each time step" -&gt; this is also true of UORO</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1lQ16dO2Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An interesting idea of improving BPTT by kernel recurrent learning.

The authors directly assume the sensitivity function between two layers with a distance of tau in a form of Eq. (7). The algorithm of BPTT is then approximated due to this assumption. The model parameters are changed to learn the network dynamics. The optimization problem turns out to estimate beta and gamma of the kernel function. The learned parameters are intuitive. There are a set of timescales to describe the memory of each neuron and a set of sensitivity weights to describe how strongly the neurons interact on average. The purpose of this study is to save the memory cost and to reduce the time complexity for online learning with comparable performance. 

Pros:
1. KeRL only needs to compute a few tensor operations at each time step, so online KeRL learns faster than online BPTT for the case with a reasonably long truncation length.
2. Biologically plausible statements are addressed.
3. A prior is imposed for the temporal sensitivity kernel. The issue of gradient vanishing is mitigated.
4. Theoretical illustration for KeRL in Sections 3 and 4 is clear and interesting.

Cons:
1. The proposed method is an approximation to BPTT training. Suppose the system performance is constrained. Some guesses are made. The system performance can be further improved.
2. The experiment on time cost due to online learning is required so that the reduction of time complexity can be illustrated.
3. The format of tables 1 and 2 can be improved. Caption is required in Table 1. Overlarge size of Table 2 can be fixed.
4.  A number of assumptions in Sections 3 and 4 are assumed.  When addressing Section 3, some assumptions in Section 4 are used. The organization of Sections 3 and 4 can be improved.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
