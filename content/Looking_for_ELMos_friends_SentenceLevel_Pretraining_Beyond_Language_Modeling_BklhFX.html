This paper contributes the first large-scale systematic study comparing different pretraining tasks in this context, both as complements to language modeling and as potential alternatives. The primary results of the study support the use of language modeling as a pretraining task and set a new state of the art among comparable models using multitask learning with language models. However, a closer look at these results reveals worryingly strong baselines and strikingly varied results across target tasks, suggesting that the widely-used paradigm of pretraining and freezing sentence encoders may not be an ideal platform for further work.

The work is focused on experiments, and draws several conclusions that are interesting, mostly around the amount of gain one can expect and the fact that the choice of the dataset is task-dependent. 

One of the issue is that the authors if seems to believe that ELMO is the best contextual language model. The field is moving so quickly that the experiments might become invalid pretty soon (e.g. see BERT model referenced below).

Finally, the analysis is mostly descriptive and there is few insight by the author about what should be the future work, apart from "we need a better understanding".


Minor details:

Page 1: "can yield very strong performance on NLP tasks" is a very busy way to express the fact that Sentence Encoders work well in practice. 

The field evolves quickly and ELMO has now a competitive models called BERT (arXiv.org &gt; cs &gt; arXiv:1810.04805). I understand that the results of the current papers would hove to be re-run on all these tasks, but I'm afraid the current paper will have a limited impact if it does not use the most effective method at the date of publication...</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1lCFrBzpm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Author response</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkl87h09FX&amp;noteId=S1lCFrBzpm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1360 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">09 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1360 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thanks for your review! We agree that we have presented informative results on a few questions surrounding pretraining. We agree with some of your additional points, but we strongly disagree with your implication they make this paper not worth publishing.

We don’t “believe that ELMO is the best contextual language model”, as you suggest. _Best_ is subjective, but we note on page 5 that Radford et al.’s Transformer model outperforms ELMo on GLUE. 

We focus on ELMo because it represented the state of the art as of spring, when we started building out the infrastructure for our experiments. Given the scale of this experiment, we would not have had time to conduct a similar analysis that follows the model and methods of Radford et al. (or BERT, which was released **after the ICLR deadline**), but we agree that a similar such analysis would be worthwhile.

We also think that research on ELMo-style models would be worthwhile even if these fine-tuning based systems had come out earlier. ELMo’s pretrain-and-freeze approach to sentence representations is already being widely deployed (see Kitaev and Klein on parsing, or Gehrmann on summarization, for example), and it is likely the most practical approach if one wants to deploy a full NLP toolkit in a setting like a mobile phone where one cannot store a full separate fine-tuned 100MB-1GB encoder file for each task model that the toolkit provides. 

Further, many of our experiments on supervised pretraining do not involve ELMo, and we argue that the paper still offers more than enough worthwhile results even if you do not accept that ELMo is in any way worth studying.

Zooming out a bit, though, we *strongly* disagree with the premise that it’s not worth publishing a paper if the baseline system does not represent the state of the art as of *publication* time, or that such papers cannot have a substantial impact. That would rule out most experimental papers, and it would rule out _any_ time-consuming analysis on exactly those topics where analysis would be most useful.

Training sentence representation in an unsupervised manner is hence crucial for real-world NLP applications.
Contextualized word representations have gained a lot of interest in recent years and the NLP and ML community could benefit from such detailed comparison of such methods.

This paper's biggest strength is the experimental setting.  The authors cover a lot of ground in comparing a lot of the recent work, both qualitatively and quantitatively -- there are a lot of experiments.
I do understand the computational limitations of the authors (as they mention on HYPERPARAMETER TUINING) and I do agree with their statement “ The choice not to tune limits our ability to diagnose the causes of poor performance when it occurs”.
Extensive hyper-parameter tuning can make a substantial different when dealing with NN models, maybe the authors should have considered dropping some of the tasks (the article has more than enough IMHO) and focus on a smaller sub set of tasks with proper hyper-parameter tuning.
Table 2 is very interesting, the results suggesting that we are indeed very far from fully robust sentence representation method.

As you note, tuning is a real limitation that we acknowledge in the paper, and it represents an unavoidable trade-off. By training a lightly-regularized parameter-rich model under training conditions that are generally known to work well, we intend to make a rough but informative comparison possible between data-rich pretraining objectives. 

Our lack of substantial hyperparameter tuning means that small differences across pretraining settings are unlikely to be meaningful, and likely means that our performance numbers for our lowest-data pretraining tasks are weaker than they would otherwise be, but we still believe that our overall conclusions are both correct and informative as-is.

The main conclusion is that both single-task and LM-based pre-training helps in most situations, but the gain is often not large, and not consistent across all GLUE tasks.

This paper represents an impressive amount of experimentation. The study and the experimental results will be useful and interesting to the community. The result that some tasks' performance are negatively correlated with each other is surprising. The paper is clearly written. 

One clarification question I have is about what the "Single-task" pre-training means. The paper seems to suggest that it consists of pre-training a model on the same task on which it is later evaluated. I'm confused by what this means, and how this is different from just training on that task. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1xYl8rzaQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Author response</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkl87h09FX&amp;noteId=r1xYl8rzaQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1360 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">09 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1360 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thanks! We agree with your overall assessment. (I guess that’s not surprising...)

The single-task baselines are a bit confusing, and we’ll clarify that point in an update shortly. 

As you describe, we pretrain a model on the same single task that we later evaluate it on. The tricky point here is that we follow the exact same training procedure here as in the other rows of that table, to make sure we’re isolating the effect of the data and not the training procedure. In that procedure, we pretrain an encoder, freeze it, then initialize and train a new task-specific model, so we wind up training two different task-specific models: one (always without attention) that’s used only during encoder pretraining, and another (always with attention) that’s trained on the frozen encoder and then evaluated.

This is fairly complex, but it allows us to make the comparisons we want to make. The single-task baselines in the original GLUE paper are trained in a single pass with a single target-task model, so those runs aren’t precisely comparable to ours.
