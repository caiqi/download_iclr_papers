One challenge with massively multi-label problems is that there is often a long-tailed frequency distribution for the labels, resulting in few positive examples for the rare labels. We propose a solution to this problem by modifying the output layer of a neural network to create a Bayesian network of sigmoids which takes advantage of ontology relationships between the labels to help share information between the rare and the more common labels.  We apply this method to the two massively multi-label tasks of disease prediction (ICD-9 codes) and protein function prediction (Gene Ontology terms) and obtain significant improvements in per-label AUROC and average precision.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">multi-label, Bayesian network, ontology</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value"> We propose a new method for using ontology information to improve performance on massively multi-label prediction/classification problems.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJg_TzB6h7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Multi-label using ontology</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1g1LoAcFm&amp;noteId=rJg_TzB6h7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper136 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper136 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes a neural network, the outputs of which create a "Bayesian network of sigmoids". This is for use in massively multi-label situations where the class outputs are connected to some ontology. By using the ontology, the performance on long-tail classes with few examples should be improved.
I like the method. It is intuitive and easy to implement. The only issue I have with the features and model is when in 3.1.2 the weights for the medical labels as input to the encoder are said to be 'tied' to the output label embeddings. I would like to have seem more justification for this (perhaps just the keeping number of parameters down?) or evaluation as to whether it helped - I think it may have hindered because of how the output label is used in the dot product.
The stated difference between this work and previous hierarchical softmax models is that they use DAG structures, not just tree structures. However, of the two datasets they try, only one (proteins) has a DAG structure to the ontology, and they do not have a baseline comparison with a hierarchical softmax model.
The method does show improvements at low number of examples against a flat sigmoid model in the small disease prediction and protein function prediction, but other results are mixed, especially for the proteins with the DAG ontology, which is where one would have liked to see an advantage.
I would like to have seen performance against a hierarchical soft max framework, or on some openly available or benchmark datasets, otherwise it is hard to judge the utility of the method.

The paper motivates very well by the observations that some labels include very small amount of data points.
However, the authors don’t really investigate why such labels are rarely observed and the experiments don’t include any significance.
Thus overall I don’t think the paper is ready for publishing for ICLR yet.

Below are some more detailed comments:
1) The authors discuss nicely about the intuition to introduce the Bayesian networks in the tasks of disease prediction. Essentially, the probability of assigning the label (leaf node) should be account for the probability of it being observed, namely the prior. Thus it is not surprising that for the rare labels, the proposed method would yield higher precision. However, the experiments don’t really include any significance measurement; especially for such tasks where the number of testing examples with rare labels is small (5~10 positive examples), significance measurement or some forms of hypothesis testing is a must-have in order to draw conclusion about the performance comparison. Answering such significance issue with tests for overfitting would be nice.

2) My other major concern is for the protein function prediction task, the reason of why for certain labels, the number of instances is small, could be due to that a) there don’t exist much biological web-lab evidence, or b) among the population, there indeed only exist small number of proteins associated with such labels. The proposed method can address b) but not necessarily address a).

3) The paper discusses the other results very briefly in Section 5 but doesn’t include any experiment comparison. Thus it is not convincing that the proposed method is making contribution to the field of disease prediction, protein function prediction or even general multi-label prediction. I would suggest to include the comparison with the state of the art methods for each application.

4) Particularly for protein function prediction, another line of studies is to use protein protein interaction networks or other sources such as functional pathways rather than using sequence information alone (ref below). Some discussion would be nice.

Strengths:
The idea of using the hierarchical structure of the labels is innovative and well-motivated. The experimental design and description of the methods is excellent. 

Weaknesses:
Overall the results are not consistently strong and there is a key baseline missing. The approach only seems help in the "rare label, small data" regime, which limits the applicability of the method but is still worthy of consideration. 

My biggest reservation is that the authors did not include a baseline where the classes are reweighted according to their frequency. Multilabel binary cross-entropy is very easy to modify to incorporate class weights (e.g. upweight the minority class for each label) and without this baseline I am unable to discern how well the method works relative to this simple baseline.

One more dataset would also strengthen the results, and since I am suggesting more work I will also try to be helpful and be specific. Predicting mesh terms from abstracts would qualify as a massive multilabel task and there is plenty of public data available here: <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html</a> 

Finally, there is one relevant paper that the authors may wish to consider in their review section: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/10/365965</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
