In the primary visual cortex of mammals, for example, one may observe during development the formation of cells selective to localized, oriented features. This leads to the development of a rough representation of contours of the retinal image in area V1. We modeled these mechanisms using sparse Hebbian learning algorithms. These algorithms alternate a coding step to encode the information with a learning step to find the proper encoder. A major difficulty faced by these algorithms is to deduce a good representation while knowing immature encoders, and to learn good encoders with a non-optimal representation. To address this problem, we propose here to introduce a new regulation process between learning and coding, called homeostasis. Our homeostasis is compatible with a neuro-mimetic architecture and allows for the fast emergence of localized filters sensitive to orientation. The key to this algorithm lies in a simple adaptation mechanism based on non-linear functions that reconciles the antagonistic processes that occur at the coding and learning time scales. We tested this unsupervised algorithm with this homeostasis rule for a range of existing unsupervised learning algorithms coupled with different neural coding algorithms. In addition, we propose a simplification of this optimal homeostasis rule by implementing a simple heuristic on the probability of activation of neurons. Compared to the optimal homeostasis rule, we show that this heuristic allows to implement a more rapid unsupervised learning algorithm while keeping a large part of its effectiveness. These results demonstrate the potential application of such a strategy in machine learning and we illustrate this with one result in a convolutional neural network.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Sparse Coding, Unsupervised Learning, Natural Scene Statistics, Biologically Plausible Deep Networks, Visual Perception, Computer Vision</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Unsupervised learning is hard and depends on normalisation heuristics.

I do not think this work should be accepted to the conference for the following reasons:

1: The authors show no benefit of this scheme except perhaps faster convergence.  If faster training of dictionary learning models was a bottleneck in practical applications, this might be of interest, but it is not.  SPAMS (<a href="http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/)</a> can train a model on image patches as the authors do here in a few tens of seconds on a modern computer.  On the other hand, the authors give no evidence, empirical or otherwise, that their method is useful on any downstream tasks.
In my view, they do not even show that the distribution of atom usage will be better with their algorithm after the learning has converged, as at least according to their learning curves, the baselines have not finished converging.  It is not even clear that the final compression of the baselines would not be better.  Even if they did show these convincingly, it is not obvious to me that it is valuable; the authors need to *show* that uniform usage is desirable.

2:    The authors should compare against several costs/algorithms (e.g. l_0 with OMP, l_1 with LARS, etc.), and across various N_0/sparsity penalties, and across several datasets.   The empirical evaluation is quite weak- one sparsity setting, two baselines, one dataset.  Even without the "train to convergence" question above, I don't think the authors have demonstrated that their claims on the properties of their algorithms/formulations are generally true.   </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: Clear rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1eP8UR9hm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Solid work but the importance unclear</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyMras0cFQ&amp;noteId=H1eP8UR9hm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper799 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper799 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Please consider this rubric when writing your review:

3. Evaluate the quality and composition of the work.
4. Place the work in context of prior work, and evaluate this work's novelty.
5. Provide critique of each theorem or experiment that is relevant to your judgment of the paper's novelty and quality.

1. I am a researcher working at the intersection of machine learning,
computational neuroscience and biological vision.  I have experience
with neural network models and visual neurophysiology.

2. This paper develops and tests an adaptive homeostatic algorithm for
unsupervised visual feature learning (for example for learning models
of early visual processing/V1).

3.The work spends a lot of pages describing the general problem of
unsupervised feature learning and the history of the base algorithms.
The literature review is quite extensive.  The new content appears to
be in section 2.2 (Histogram Equalization Homeostasis - HEH), where a
simple idea to keep all units with balanced activity over the set of
natural images.  The authors also develop a computationally cheaper
version they call HAP (Homeostasis on Activation Probability) The
authors show that their F function is optimized quicker with the HEH
and HAP algorithms.  I would like to see how these curves vary with
the number of neurons (e.g. can you add X% more neurons and get
similar convergence speed -- and if so which is more computationally
costly)?

4. Many groups have developed various homeostatic algorithms for
unsupervised learning, though I have not seen this exact one before.

5.  The experiments reveal the resulting receptive fields and show the 
decrease in the F function (error function).    The resulting receptive fields
do not seem that different to me between the different methods.  I am also not
that convinced that the faster convergence as a function of learning step is that important
especially as the learning steps may be more computationally expensive for this method.

6. I am not sure how interesting this work will be for the ICLR audience,
as it is not clear how important the faster convergence and more even
utilization of neurons is (and how it would compare computationally
with just having more neurons).

for dictionary updates take into account the past updates. It is argued
that time takes a crucial rule in learning.

The paper is quite well written and contains an extensive literature review
demonstrating a good understanding of previous literature in both ML/DL and biological
vision.

The idea of using a "non-linear gain normalization" to adjust atom selection
in sparse coding is interesting and as far as I know novel, while providing
interesting empirical results: The system learns in an unsupervised way faster.

Misc:

- Using &lt; &gt; for latex brakets is not ideal. I would recommend: $\langle\,,\rangle$

- "derivable" I guess you mean "differentiable"

- Oliphant and Hunter are cited for Numpy/scipy and matplotlib but the
reference to Pedregosa et al. for sklearn is missing.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
