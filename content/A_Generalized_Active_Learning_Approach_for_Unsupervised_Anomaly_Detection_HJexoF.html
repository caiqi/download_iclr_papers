However the proposed approach of requesting expert feedback for the top ranked anomalies is straightforward and unsurprising, given past work on active learning. 
The experiments on synthetic data are also unsurprising. Moreover these are based on a questionable premise: the instances that are "hard" to classify are treated as anomalies. This is not very realistic.
Regarding the real data experiments: In Table 1 the results for DAE_uai are based on which budget b?  How does the result vary with b?

The paper's organization is, at times quite confusing:
- the introduction is unusually short, with a 1st paragraph virtually unreadable due to the abuse of citations. Two additional paragraphs, covering in an intuitive manner both the proposed approach &amp; the main results, would dramatically improve the paper's readability
- section 2.1 starts quite abruptly with he two Lemmas 7 and Theorem 3 (which, in fact, is Theorem 1). This section would probably read a lot better without the two Lemmas, as the authors only refer to the main result in the Theorem. The second, intuitive part of 2.1 is extremely helpful.
- it is unclear why the authors have applied the approach in "4.3" only to a single dataset, rather than all the 11 datasets

Most claims of novelty can be clearly refuted such as the first sentence of the abstract "...This work presents a new approach to active anomaly detection..." and the paper does not give due credit to existing work. Current research such as Das et al. which is the most relevant has been deliberately not introduced upfront with other works (because it shows lack of the present paper's novelty) and instead deferred to later sections. The onus of a thorough literature review and laying down a proper context is on the authors, not the reviewers. Detailed comments are below.
      
      1. Related Works: "...active anomaly detection remains an under-explored approach to this problem..."
          - Active learning in anomaly detection is well-researched (AI2, etc.). See related works section in Das et al. 2016 and:
            - K. Veeramachaneni, I. Arnaldo, A. Cuesta-Infante, V. Korrapati, C. Bassias, and K. Li, "Ai2: Training a big data machine to defend," International Conference on Big Data Security, 2016.
        
      2. "To deal with the cold start problem, for the first 10 calls of select_top...":
          - No principled approach to deal with cold start and one-sided labels (i.e., the ability to use labels when instances from only one class are labeled.)
        
      3. Many arbitrary hyper parameters as compared to simpler techniques:
          - The number of layers, nodes in hidden layers.
            - The number of instances (k) per iteration
            - The number of pretraining iterations
            - The number of times the network is retrained (100) after each labeling call
            - Dealing with cold start (10 labeling iterations of 10 labels each, i.e. 100 labels).
        
      4. The paper mentions that s(x) might not be differentiable. However, the sigmoid form of s(x) is differentiable.
      
      5. Does not acknowledge the well-known result that mixture models are unidentifiable. The math in the paper is mostly redundant. Some references:

      6. Does not acknowledge existing work that adds classifier over unsupervised detectors (such as AI2). This is very common.
        - This is another linear model (logistic) on top of transformed features. The difference is that the transformed features are from a neural network and optimization can be performed in a joint fashion. The novelty is marginal.
        
      7. While the paper argues that a prior needs to be assumed, it does not use any in the algorithm. There seems to be a disconnect. It also does not acknowledge that AAD (LODA/Tree) does use a prior. Priors for anomaly proportions in unsupervised algorithms are well-known (most AD algos support that such as OC-SVM, Isolation Forest, LOF, etc.).
        
      8. Does not compare against current state-of-the-art Tree-based AAD

      9. The 'Generalized' in the title is incorrect and misleading. This is specific to deep-networks. Stacking supervised classifiers on unsupervised detectors is very common. See comments on related works.
      
      10. Does not propose any other query strategies than greedily selecting top.

In this work we present new methods based on the proposed new architectures (UaiNets), which we see as a new approach to active anomaly detection. This might be better phrased as "This work presents new active anomaly detection methods". And we do give credit to Das et al. stating " The most similar prior work to ours in this setting is (Das et al., 2016), which proposed an algorithm that can be employed on top of any ensemble methods based on random projections.", but we should have mentioned it in Section 3.1 when we describe our approach and we will fix this during the rebuttal period. Nonetheless this was not ill intended or deliberate.
We address each of your detailed comments bellow:

1. We still believe it is an under-explored approach to this problem. In the well known (Chandola et al. 2009) survey, they don't mention active learning at all. Only citing (Abe et al. 2006) as supervised anomaly detection. (Das et al. 2016) only has 12 citations and (Das et al. 2017) has only one self-citation. These are some really interesting works in this area, but we believe if this was a well-researched topic they would have more recognition (assuming citations can be used as a measure for recognition).
   Nonetheless, we should indeed have cited (Veeramachaneni et al. 2016) and (Das et al. 2017). We will add it during the rebuttal phase.

2. Our architecture can be built on top of state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection models, so using them during our models cold start is a good option. it gives state of the art anomaly detection in these first steps.
   We state in the paper though that an interesting future work would be "using the UAI layers confidence in its output to dynamically choose between either directly using its scores, or using the underlying unsupervised model’s anomaly score to choose which instances to audit next".
   This is not straight forward though, since confidence scores from deep learning architectures are usually unregulated.

3. Our model has several hyper parameters, but we show through our experiments that the network can produce good results to all analyzed datasets with the same choice of hyper parameters.
   We only change k when dealing with datasets with few anomalies to give the model the chance to further interact with labels.
   Our algorithm is robust to k. For k ∈ {5; 10; 20; 30; 40; 50; 100}, using KDDCUP-rev, we get F1 scores of {0.90; 0.91; 0.90; 0.90; 0.91; 0.91; 0.91}, respectively, with no statistical difference between them (p &lt; 0.1).
   The choice of k is left to the user, since it might depend on their business model.
   A large company with several experts might want to parallelize the models feedback and get more instances per iteration with the model.

Both base models used have differentiable s(x) (squared error in DAE and sigmoid in classifier), but we wanted to build an architecture which could (potentially) be applied to different deep learning models in the future. Since this models might have non differentiable s(x) we didn't allow gradients to flow through it in our experiments.
   we didn't test this, but we believe we might actually see better results if we allowed gradients through s(x).

5. We believe our results expand on the unidentifiability of mixture models, showing that in this case *all* possible options are equally unidentifiable.
   Nonetheless we should have cited these results and will mention and compare to them during rebuttal phase.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BklLwmi_n7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Thank you for the feedback. - Continuation</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJex0o05F7&amp;noteId=BklLwmi_n7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper864 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper864 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">6. We do not think the novelty is marginal.
   Deep Learning architectures excel exactly as feature extractors, being great for learning representations.
   Besides, we show through the experiments in Appendix C.1 that end to end learning helps the base architecture learn better feature representations for anomaly detection.

7. We do not argue that a prior needs to be assumed for all cases (although the no free lunch theorem does). We only argue that unsupervised anomaly detection needs one.
   Supervised algorithms have, in general, presented good priors for most supervised learning problems, and the UAI layer learns in a supervised (active) way.
   We also show in Section 4.1 that although unsupervised active learning have to trade off accuracy in a setting for another, active algorithms are robust to their choice and can give good results in all analyzed settings.

8. We should have compared to them. Here are the results:
Tree-AAD      0.89* 0.29 0.86 0.50 0.32 0.53 0.69 0.76 0.94 0.59 0.92
DAE_uai        0.94   0.47 0.57 0.91 0.33 0.55 0.66 0.64 0.86 0.60 0.93
In order: KDDCUP, Arrhythmia, Thyroid, KDDCUP-Rev, Yeast, Abalone, CTG, Credit Card, Covtype, MMG, Shuttle
* to to run Tree-AAD on KDDCUP we needed to limit its memory about the anomalies it had already learned, forgetting the oldest ones. This reduced its runtime complexity from O(b^2) to O(b) in our tests, where b is the budget limit for the anomaly detection task.

9. We can see how it might be misleading and will consider changing the title.

10. Greedily selecting top is a good strategy in practical settings and (Das et al. 2016) and (Das et al. 2017) also use it.
    In practical scenarios we want to have the most anomalies for a given budget, so selecting the most anomalous instance at a time is a useful strategy.
    Also, if we select a non anomalous instance, we will use it to correct our probability distribution, improving our results in the next iteration.
    Finally, since anomaly detection is already a highly imbalanced setting, we might not get anomalous instances even when picking top anomalous results, so actively searching them might be a good choice.

11. What do you mean by streaming?
    Section 4.3 shows a setting when we have new anomalous instances arriving and we want to detect anomalies in it.
    If you wanted to run it on streaming data you would need to revisit the previously labeled instances every one in a while to keep training on them, while continuing training the base model on the streamed data.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
