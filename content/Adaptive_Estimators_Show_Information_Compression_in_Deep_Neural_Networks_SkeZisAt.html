The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant for the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when the networks used a saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed a more robust mutual information estimation technique, that adapts to hidden activity of neural networks and produces more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also found that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">deep neural networks, mutual information, information bottleneck, noise, L2 regularization</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We developed robust mutual information estimates for DNNs and used them to observe compression in networks with non-saturating activation functions</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_ByldLTe9nm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting observations!</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkeZisA5t7&amp;noteId=ByldLTe9nm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper595 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper595 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors of this paper studied the popular belief that deep neural networks do information compression for supervised tasks. They studied this compression behavior with tanh and ReLU (and it's variants) activation functions which are saturating and non saturating in nature respectively. 

The compression score is computed using Mutual Information Estimation which when computed are usually infinite. For finite mutual information values, noise can be added to hidden activations. For this purpose, two approaches namely Entropy Based Binning(EBAB) and adaptive Kernel Density Estimation(aKDE) were explored. EBAB adds noise to the hidden activations by binning and aKDE by Gaussian noise. Their results show that both EBAB and aKDE exhibit compression in case of ReLU, although this behavior is the strongest in tanh. 

Finally, When compression score was plotted against accuracy, higher rates of compression did not show significant correlation with generalization. Hence showing evidence that generalization(or good performance) can be achieved even without information bottleneck(information compression).

Qualms:
1. Figure 7's description that ELU, Swish and centered softplus functions doing compression is not very apparent. 
2. Figure 9b: Regression line between compression score and accuracy shows a positive correlation between them. This seems contradictory to the inference.
3. The experiments were done on a 5-layer network with 10-7-5-4-3 nodes respectively on a toy data of 12-bit binary vectors. The study could have included bigger networks with popular datasets which would give substantial support to the trend observed on toy data.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_ryeconnthX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>This paper uses information to show compression of DNN with unbounded activation function, but it gives no questions to what form the compression.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkeZisA5t7&amp;noteId=ryeconnthX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper595 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper595 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes a method for the estimation of mutual information for networks with unbounded activation functions and the use of L2 regularization to induce more compression.  The use of information planes to study the training behavior of networks is not new.  This paper addresses the issue of unbounded  hidden state activities.  As the differential mutual information in DNN is ill-defined, the authors proposed to add noise to the hidden activity by using the binning process.   It is not clear in the paper that if the binning is applied just for visualizing the information plane or for computing the activities of hidden units in upper layers.   If it is the latter one, it creates unnecessary distortions to the DNN.  As the authors pointed out, different initializations can lead to different behaviour on the information plane.  It would be difficult to draw conclusions based on the experimental results, even they come from the average of 50 individual networks.  Also, the experiences are performed using a particular task, it is not sure if similar behavior is observed in other tasks.   It is, however, more important to understand what makes the compression.   For the L2 regularization, the compression is expected as the regularization tends to limit the values of the  weights. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Hklpw8gLnQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Review</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkeZisA5t7&amp;noteId=Hklpw8gLnQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper595 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">30 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper595 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper has 3 principal contributions: it proposes a different way of measuring mutual information in a neural network, proposes a compression score to compare different models, then empirically analyses different activation functions and L2 weights.

This work seems like a welcome addition to the IB thread. To me the most interesting result is simply that activation functions aren't simply about gradient flow, and that they may each have properties that are more or less desirable depending on the domain they might be used on. The authors are careful in the wording of their conclusions, I think with reason; while these results are useful in that there seem to be consistently different behaviors coming from different hyperparameters, information planes show a relatively qualitative part of the picture.

Quantitatively, the proposed compression score is interesting, but as the authors say, simplistic. It seems to me that we care more about the converged models than the whole training trajectory; how does this score evolve with time?

I think an important part of discussion that lacks in this paper is a more in-depth take as to how these findings relate to the Zhang et al [1] memorization vs generalization paper and its follow ups. There seem to be many links to be drawn.

This work is overall a good contribution, but I'll have to agree with the authors' conclusion that more principled analysis methods are required to have a solid grasp of the training dynamics of DNNs. The writing of the paper is good, but the writing of the captions could be improved. (the hard page limit of ICLR is 10 pages and your paper has a lot of captions, so I think investing into a bit more text would be good)


Comments:
- It might be worth to re-explain what the information plane plots are in a figure caption, not just in the text (the text also doesn't really explain that each point is a moment in training, and each thread a different layer, this paper should be readable by someone who has never seen these plots before). 
- It's not clear what is going on in figure 5, I can guess but, again, this paper should be readable by anyone in the field. You mention different initializations, but which exactly? What makes you say that 5c has no compression but that 5a does compression first? It should be explained explicitly.
- I believe what you say about Figure 8, but the plots are so similar that it is hard to compare them visually. Maybe a different kind of superposition into a single plot would better illustrate the compression effect of L2?
- Typo in the x axis caption of figures 9.
- Figure 9a is not readable in greyscale (or by a colorblind person), consider using a different symbol for the softmax scatter (and adding this symbol to the legend).
- The first Schmidhuber citation of the paper seems a bit out of place. I think he himself would say that deep learning has been going on for much longer than since 2015. (in fact I think you could just remove the entire first paragraph, it is just unnecessary boilerplate)
- Why should there be a direct correlation between compression and generalization? For example, it is known that training DNNs with soft targets improves test accuracy in classification, or even forcing softness in both targets and representations [2] also improves test accuracy.
- I'm still personally not sold on binning as a strategy to evaluate MI. Did you perform experiments that show that the observed difference is consistent if more computation is done to approximate MI, and not just an artefact of max-entropy binning?
