Recent work has built on variational autoencoders to develop variational recurrent models for generation. Our main goal is not generation but rather representation learning for downstream prediction tasks. Existing variational recurrent models typically use stochastic recurrent connections to model the dependence among neighboring latent variables, while generation assumes independence of generated data per time step given the latent sequence. In contrast, our models assume independence among all latent variables given non-stochastic hidden states, which speeds up inference, while assuming dependence of observations at each time step on all latent variables, which improves representation quality.  In addition, we propose and study extensions for improving downstream performance, including hierarchical auxiliary latent variables and prior updating during training. Experiments show improved performance on several speech and language tasks with different levels of supervision, as well as in a multi-view learning setting.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Representation learning, variational model</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_ByeZL0VCh7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Needs stronger motivation, better analysis would improve the paper</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxCenR5F7&amp;noteId=ByeZL0VCh7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1124 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1124 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This is largely an experimental paper, proposing and evaluating various modifications of variational recurrent models towards obtaining sequence data representations that are effective in downstream tasks. The highlighted contribution is a "stochastic generation" training procedure in which the training objective evaluates the reconstruction of output sequence elements from individual latent variables independently. The main claim is that the resulting model, augmented with prior updating and/or hierarchical latent variables, improves results w.r.t. the baselines.

My main concern is that the various choices are not motivated well, e.g. with examples or detailed descriptions of the issues addressed and that the resulting implications are not discussed in detail (see detailed comments below). This could perhaps be alleviated during the rebuttal discussion.

Empirically, when used in conjunction with prior updating and/or hierarchical latent variables, the proposed "stochastic generation" approach improves upon the baselines, but not when used in isolation. This is OK, but it weakens the contribution since it's more unclear what the exact advantage "stochastic generation" is, how it takes advantage of prior updating, and so on. Could you maybe discuss this in the rebuttal? The fact that not all model variants considered are evaluated on all settings also contributes to this problem (again, see below).

General questions:
- "dependence of observations at each time step on all latent variables": Unfortunately, this means that the complexity of evaluating the model during training is O(n^2), where n is the sequence size, rather than linear in the standard case. Is that correct? I think this is what is alluded to on the top on page 4. Could you discuss this trade-off?
- regarding section 2.1.: Multi-modal marginal probabilities are also used due their increased modeling power, and this again seems like a potential limitation of the proposed approach w.r.t. the baseline, and is not discussed.
- "the mean of z_t may have very small probability and thus may not be a good choice": I think this statement requires more context. The mean of z_t can have low probability in both cases (e.g. if the posterior has a high variance). Are you suggesting that the low probability issue is exacerbated by to the sampling of previous z_{t-1}? Or are you comparing to the case where the mean z_{t-1} is used instead of sampling as well?

Stochastic generation:
- While I understand where it's coming from, the term "stochastic generation" is somewhat misleading, since stochasticity is already present in the generation process for VAEs;
- Stochastic generation is introduced as a way to approximate the generation process. However, when it's introduced, it's not clear what the generation process that needs to be approximated is. Introducing the model in eq. (6-7), motivating its use and then showing how it is obtained through stochastic generation second would improve the clarity of the paper.
- Related to the point above, the implications of using the model in eq. (6-7) are not discussed. The graphical model in Figure 1 suggests that x_k depends jointly on all the (z_t)_{t=1 ... sequence_size}. Instead, in eq. (6-7), each x_k is generated independently from each z_t (for t = 1 ... T, and k sampled from a distribution which depends on t). In particular, if I understand this correctly, the distribution p(x_k | z) = p(x_k | z_1 \dots z_T) factorizes as p(x_k | z_1) p(x_k | z_2) ... p(x_k | z_T). Could you motivate this choice and its expected effect? It seems to me that this encourages each z_t to capture all the information needed to reconstruct each x_k in the corresponding window.

Experimental results:
- Table 2: I think this table since it includes most models, but it still misses RecRep (without delta = 0) and StocCon. Could you confirm whether StocCon vs. RecRep have the same setting except the use of recurrent stochastic connections in StocCon vs. using eq. (4) in RecRep with window size 1?
- In Table 4, the difference between line 5 and line 6 is interesting and I wish it was discussed more, maybe used in the visualization experiment to show how/why "stochastic generation" with a larger window improves performance.
- Figure 3, could it be that the use of hierarchical latent variables (H) accounts for the visual difference? Is a difference still observed when comparing lines 3 and 7 in Table 4, whose settings seem more comparable?
- 

Minor issues:
- the lack of parenthesis around citations makes the text hard to follow at times (maybe use \citep whenever the citation mixes with the text?);
- typo: "for use in a downstream tasks"
- typo: "with graphical model as described" =&gt; "with the/a graphical model as described"

The authors claim to propose a family of methods and generative models that are suited better for downstream tasks than previously proposed approaches.

## Major points

It feels as if the proposed method tries to be many things. First, it is used for finding unsupervised representations down stream. Then, it still tries to be a generative model "of sorts", which is the reason for the use of variational inference in the first place. Additionally, the approximate posterior necessary to evaluate the ELBO is simultaneously used as a feature extractor.

The resulting issues are:

  - A "bad" variational posterior is used because it is unclear how to get vectorial features otherwise. 
  - An adhoc likelihood function is used, which is not sufficiently well explored theoretically in the paper.  Specifically,
      - Stochastic generation is claimed to be "more complex than simple Gaussian"; the burden of proof is on the authors, as Gaussian density is closed under multiplication. 
      - It appears to be a Monte Carlo approximation to sth that is computable in closed form.
      - It is not clear if that MC approximation is normalised and if the normalisation is the same at each optimisation step. Does this bias optimisation? What happens to the KL penalty weight?
  - The ELBO change (prior updating) seems to make the claim that we still have a generative model (as written in the intro) invalid. My intuition is that the KL penalty vanishes for small step rates of the optimiser, reducing the model to that of a noisy auto encoder.


## Summary

The authors want to evaluate variational sequence models for feature extraction for downstream tasks. But why? What is the use of a generative inspired algorithm, when necessary ingredients are discarded? Both goals appear to be at conflict and I am not convinced that the variational ingredient is necessary.

I do not cover the experimental section since the method itself has issues so severe that I don't consider it relevant. 


## Minor points

- Notation $\mu_{\phi_t}$ gives the impression that $\phi$ is time dependent.
- Equations (9) and (11) are formatted badly.
- The approximate posterior used was used first in (Bayer &amp; Osendorfer, "Learning stochastic recurrent networks", 2014) not (Chen 2018).
- Diagrams follow GM notation only half-heartedly.

Comparing to existing work, instead of having latent variables that are dependent on the neighbors, this paper proposes to use independent latent variables with observations that are generated from multiple latent variables. 
The paper further combined the proposed method with multiple existing ideas, such as the shared/prviate representation from VAE-CCAE, adding the hierarchical structure, and prior updating. 

Pros:
The proposed method seems technical correct and reasonable. 
There are many extensions which are potentially useful for many applications 
There are many experimental results showing promising performance. 

Cons:
The framework is very incremental. It is novel but limited. 
The paper claim that the main point to use the simpler variations distribution is to speed up the inference. But no speed comparisons are shown in the experiments section. 
The evaluation shows that prior updating (one extension) seems contributes to the biggest performance gain, not the main proposed method.
