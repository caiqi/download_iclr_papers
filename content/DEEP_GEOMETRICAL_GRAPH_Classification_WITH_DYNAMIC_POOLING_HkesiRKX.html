Generally, they consist of several steps of message passing between the nodes followed by a global indiscriminate feature pooling function. However, most of the times the nodes are unlabeled or their labels (or the given feature vectors of the nodes) provide no information about the similarity between the nodes and the locations of the nodes in the graph. Accordingly, message passing may not propagate helpful information throughout the graph. We show that this conventional approach fails to learn to solve even simple graph classification tasks. We alleviate this serious shortcoming of the GNNs by making them a two step method where in the second step, the message passing block is given the continuous features obtained by the embedding algorithm in the first step. The GNN learns to solve the given task by inferring the topological structure of the graph encoded in the spatial distribution of the embedded vectors. The second challenge we address in this paper is designing a pooling algorithm applicable to graphs. We turn the problem of graph down-sampling into a column sampling problem, i.e., the sampling algorithm samples a subset of the nodes whose feature vectors preserve the spatial distribution of all the feature vectors. We apply the proposed approach to several established benchmark data sets and it is shown that the proposed geometrical approach strongly improves the state-of-the-art for several data-sets.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Graph classification, Deep Learning, Graph pooling, Embedding</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">A deep learning based graph classification method plus a new adaptive method for graph pooling. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Syxu1oN9nX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A paper addressing an interesting problem, but lacks clarity and hard to understand, tech novelty is unknown</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkes0iR9KX&amp;noteId=Syxu1oN9nX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper926 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper926 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes a deep GNN network for graph classification problems using their adaptive graph pooling layer. It turns the graph down-sampling problem into a column sampling problem. The approach is applied to several benchmark datasets and achieves good results.

Weakness

1.	This paper is poorly written and hard to follow. There are lots of typos even in the abstract. It should be at least proofread by an English-proficient person before submitted. For example, in the last paragraph before Section 3. “In Ying et al. ……. In Ying et al.”
2.	In paragraph 1 of Section 3, there should be 9 pixels around the center pixel including itself in regular 3x3 convolution layers.
3.	The definition of W in Eq(2) is vague. Is this W shared across all nodes? If so, what’s the difference between this and regular GNN layers except for replacing summation with a max function?
4.	The network proposed in this paper is just a simple CNN. GNN can adopt such kind of architectures as well. And I didn’t get numbers of first block in Figure 1. The input d is 64?
5.	The algorithm described in Algorithm 1 is hard to follow. There are some latex tools for coding the algorithms.
6.	The authors claim that improvements on several datasets are strong. But I think the improvement is not that big. For some datasets, the network without pooling layers even performs better at one dataset. The authors didn’t provide enough analysis on these parts.

Strength:
1.	The idea used in this paper for graph nodes sampling is interesting. But it needs more experimental studies to support this idea.

The main purpose is the classification of graphs.

The topic is timely and should be of interest to the ICLR community. 

The proposed approach consists of four parts: 

Initial feature transformation
Local features aggregation
Graph pooling
Final aggregator

Unfortunately, each of the part is poorly explained and/or a method that has already been used before. For instance, the local feature aggregation is more or less identical to a GCN as introduced by Kipf and Welling. There are now numerous flavors of GCNs and the proposed aggregation function in (2) is not novel. 

Graph pooling is also a relatively well-established idea and has been investigated in several papers before. The authors should provide more details on their approach and compare it to existing graph pooling approaches. 

Neither (1) nor (4) are novel contributions. 

The experiments look OK but are not ground-breaking and are not enough to make this paper more than a mere combination of existing methods. 

The experiments do not provide standard deviation. Graph classification problems usually exhibit a large variance of the means. Hence, it is well possible that the difference in mean is not statistically significant. 

The paper could also benefit from a clearer explanation of the method. The explanation of the core parts (e.g., the graph pooling) are difficult to understand and could be made much clearer.

Therefore, they propose to use the node embedding features from DeepWalk as (additional) input for the graph convolution. Moreover, a graph pooling operator is proposed, which clusters node pairs in a greedy fashion based on the l2-distances between feature vectors. The proposed methods are evaluated on seven common benchmark datasets and achieve better or comparable results to existing methods. Moreover, the method is evaluated using synthetic toy examples, showing that the proposed extensions help to infer topological structures.

A main point of criticism is that the authors claim that graph convolution is not able to infer the topological structure of a graph when no labels are present. In fact the graph convolution operator is closely related to the Weisfeiler-Lehman heuristic for graph isomorphism testing and can distinguish most graphs in many practical application. Therefore, it is not clear why DeepWalk features would increase the expressive power of graph convolution. It should be stated clearly which structural properties can be distinguished using DeepWalk features, but no with mere graph convolution.
The example on page 4 provides only a weak motivation for the approach: The nodes v_1 and v_2 should be indistinguishable since they are generated using the same generator. Thus, the problem is the mean/max pooling, and not the graph convolution. When using the sum-aggregation and global add pooling, graphs with two clusters and graphs with three clusters are distinguishable again. Further insights how DeepWalk helps to learn more "meaningful" topological features are required to justify its use.

Clustering nodes that are close in feature space for pooling is a reasonable idea. However, this contradicts the intuition of clustering neighboring nodes in the graph. A short discussion of this phenomenon would strengthen the paper in my opinion.

There are several other questions that not been answered adequately in the article.

* The 10-fold cross validation is usually performed using an additional validation set. What kind of stopping criteria has bee use? * It would be helpful to provide standard deviations on these small datasets (although a lot of papers sadly dismiss them).
* I really like the use of synthetic data to show superior expressive power, but I am unsure whether this can be contributed to DeepWalk or the use of the proposed pooling operator (or both). Please divide the results for these toy experiments in "GEO-DEEP" and "GEO-deep no pooling". As far as I understand, node features in different clusters should be indistinguishable from each other (even when using DeepWalk), so I contribute this success to the proposed pooling operator.
* A visualization of the graphs obtained by the proposed pooling operator would be helpful. How do the coarsened graphs look like? Given that any nodes can end up in the same cluster, and the neighborhood is defined to be the union of the neighboring nodes of the node pairs, I guess coarsened graphs are quite dense.
* DiffPool (NIPS 2018, Ying et al.) learns assignment matrices based on a simple GCN model (and thus infers topological structure from message passing). How is the proposed pooling approach related to DiffPool (except that its non-differentiable)? How does it perform when using only the features generated by a GCN? How does it compare to other pooling approaches commonly used, e.g., Graclus? At the moment, it is quite hard to judge the benefits of the proposed pooling operator in comparison to others.


In summary, the paper presents promising experimental results, but lacks a theoretical justification or convincing intuition for the proposed approach. Therefore, at this point I cannot recommend its acceptance.


Minor remarks:

* p2: The definition of "neighbour set" is needless in its current form.
* p2: The discussion of graph kernels neglects the fact that many graph kernels compute feature vectors that can be used with linear SVMs.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
