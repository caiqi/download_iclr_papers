This is due to the difficulty of estimating the phase of clean speech. To improve speech enhancement performance, we tackle the phase estimation problem in three ways. First, we propose Deep Complex U-Net, an advanced U-Net structured model incorporating well-defined complex-valued building blocks to deal with complex-valued spectrograms. Second, we propose a polar coordinate-wise complex-valued masking method to reflect the distribution of complex ideal ratio masks. Third, we define a novel loss function, weighted source-to-distortion ratio (wSDR) loss, which is designed to directly correlate with a quantitative evaluation measure. Our model was evaluated on a mixture of the Voice Bank corpus and DEMAND database, which has been widely used by many deep learning models for speech enhancement. Ablation experiments were conducted on the mixed dataset showing that all three proposed approaches are empirically valid. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in all metrics, outperforming previous approaches by a large margin.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">speech enhancement, deep learning, complex neural networks, phase estimation</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes a novel complex masking method for speech enhancement along with a loss function for efficient phase estimation.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">6 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SyxRGSbR37" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>well written &amp; rather experimental paper -- for the experts mostly</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkeRTsAcYm&amp;noteId=SyxRGSbR37"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper850 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper850 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper is written, provides good description of the state-of-the-art and comprehensive experimental results.

Below are the responses to each of your concerns.

The methodological contribution is mild, essentially changing a building block in a state-of-the-art neural architecture.
-&gt; Answer:
We agree that the change of building block (DCUNet) itself might be considered as a mild contribution with respect to methodological points. However, in addition to the modification, our main contributions include a novel masking approach and an advanced loss function design. We believe it is not trivial to successfully incorporate these components, as this results in remarkable performance improvement from the previously proposed methods. Furthermore, as far as we are concerned, this is the first work that enables efficient phase estimation using continuous regression with a complex-valued method.


The paper is for the expert audience mostly and is difficult to grasp without a good background on deep learning for speech enhancement.
-&gt; Answer:
Thank you for pointing this out. As most of the general audience may have less understanding about speech signal modeling, we added additional explanations to the Introduction we consider fundamental for a wider range of audience.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HylyWCnnnm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>review of "Phase-Aware Speech Enhancement with Deep Complex U-Net"</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkeRTsAcYm&amp;noteId=HylyWCnnnm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper850 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper850 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper tackles one of important speech enhancement issues of how to predict phase information. The authors work on this problem based on three novel techniques, one is to use complex U-net, second is to propose a new complex mask representation, which is well bounded and well model complex mask distribution, and the last is an objective function motivated by SDR. The paper is well written, and also shows the experimental effectiveness of the proposed method by analyzing these three novel techniques and also by comparing the method with other speech enhancement methods. My major concern about this paper is that this paper is a little bit too specific to the speech enhancement applications, which will not be accepted with so many researches in the major ICLR community. My suggestion is to describe some potential applications of this method to the other (speech) applications including speech separation, noise-robust front-end for ASR, TTS, or other speech analysis, and also discuss the possibility of extending this method for multichannel input. I’m more interested in the multichannel enhancement because the phase (difference) is critical in this scenario. 

Comments:
- Introduction: It’s better to cite and discuss the paper of “E. Hakan et al, “Phase-sensitive and recognition-boosted speech separation using deep recurrent neural networks,” Proc. ICASSP’15, pp. 708--712 (2015). This paper is one of the first studies tries to incorporate the phase information to DNN based speech enhancement.
- Several researchers prefer to use LSTM based enhancement method. Please discuss wether this method (objective function and complex masks) can be applied to complex extensions of LSTMs instead of complex U-net.

-&gt; Answer:
Thank you for your suggestion. We will add more explanations on potential applications and describe speech enhancement as a fundamental problem for general audio tasks.


I’m more interested in the multichannel enhancement because the phase (difference) is critical in this scenario. 
-&gt; Answer:
We acknowledge the importance of such scenarios and also are interested in studying the case. We will add a discussion in the future work.


- Introduction: It’s better to cite and discuss the paper of “E. Hakan et al, “Phase-sensitive and recognition-boosted speech separation using deep recurrent neural networks,” Proc. ICASSP’15, pp. 708--712 (2015). This paper is one of the first studies tries to incorporate the phase information to DNN based speech enhancement.
-&gt; Answer:
Thank you for the suggestion. We will add sentences to the Introduction as one of the initial dnn-based approaches incorporating phase information.


- Several researchers prefer to use LSTM based enhancement method. Please discuss whether this method (objective function and complex masks) can be applied to complex extensions of LSTMs instead of complex U-net.
-&gt; Answer:
Thank you for your idea for extension. As you mentioned, our objective function and complex masking method can be applied to complex-valued LSTMs, which will be expected to be effective for sequential representation learning and potentially improve the performance. We will add this discussion to the Conclusion.

-&gt; Answer:
Thank you for notifying us, but we were not aware of this paper since the deadline was the end of September. As it is very relevant in terms of phase estimation, we will refer to this work in the paper.


- Page 3, it’s better to explicitly mention that h = x + i y
-&gt; Answer:
We will fix this in the updated version soon.


- Section 3.3: discuss how we treat STFT/iSTFT operations under a computational graph representation. It is not so obvious.
-&gt; Answer:
We will add the description in Section 3.3.


- Section 3.3: again it’s better to mention E. Hakan’s method here.
-&gt; Answer:
We will refer to the E. Haken’s method in Section 3.2 as it is more related to the masking method.


- Page 6 footnote: I cannot access to the URL. Please check it.
-&gt; Answer:
We think the URL doesn’t work because the underbars have been removed from from the hyperlink. We will fix this.

- Experiments: I think it would be more interesting to add SDR (using speech and noise as a source) to the experimental measure. Some people use SDR as a speech enhancement measure, and I’m expecting that this method can have more reasonable performance since it is optimized based on wSDR.
-&gt; Answer:
For quick comparison, we evaluated SDR for DCUnet-20 with the BDT mask setting, and obtained the following results:
	       Spc      Wav     wSDR
SDR      23.17 | 23.99 | 24.16
SSNR     9.54  | 12.34 | 13.29 
As expected, wSDR yielded the best performance among the three loss terms compared in the paper.
However, we would like to note that SDR is essentially scale-invariant SNR, and since wSDR loss tries to fit the scale of the target source, it leads to maximizing SNR (not scale-invariant) more than maximizing SDR. This can be confirmed by the fact that more dramatic improvement is observed in terms of SSNR rather than SDR.

For me, the complex-valued network is already there and weighted SDR loss is not difficult to think. The modified complex ratio mask is a bit interesting. However, I think it better to compare with [Donald S Williamson et al] where the hyperbolic tangent compression is used.

Apart from the objective metrics, a human listening test using MOS or preference score should be conducted.

On Fig 3, the unbounded complex mask might suffer from the infinity problem leading to training failure. However, on table 2, the performance of the unbounded mask is quite close to your method. It is a bit strange for me.

The total idea is good, but the novelty is not much.

-&gt; Answer:
Thank you for your suggestion. In fact, we tried this before. Since the perceptual quality of hyperbolic tangent compression was not good compared to the other masking methods, we did not add the results in our manuscript. However, as you suggested, we think it is fair to have the actual quantitative results to compare, and thus we are currently retraining the network using hyperbolic tangent compression and will report the result as soon as the training finishes.


Apart from the objective metrics, a human listening test using MOS or preference score should be conducted.
-&gt; Answer:
Thank you for your suggestion. We will conduct a user listening study with random samples from the test dataset and update the manuscript by adding the results as soon as possible.


On Fig 3, the unbounded complex mask might suffer from the infinity problem leading to training failure. However, on table 2, the performance of the unbounded mask is quite close to your method. It is a bit strange for me.
-&gt; Answer:
Although it may seem to theoretically suffer from the infinite search space, the real distribution of the ideal complex masks are most likely bounded to a small finite region, which is likely to help alleviate the problem. In our case, we had no such problems when training our models.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
