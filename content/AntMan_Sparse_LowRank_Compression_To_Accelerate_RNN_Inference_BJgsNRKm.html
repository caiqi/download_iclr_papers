To address this issue, we develop AntMan, combining structured sparsity with low-rank decomposition synergistically, to reduce model computation, size and execution time of RNNs while attaining desired accuracy. AntMan extends knowledge distillation based training to learn the compressed models efficiently. Our evaluation shows that AntMan offers up to 100x computation reduction with less than 1pt accuracy drop for language and machine reading comprehension models. Our evaluation also shows that for a given accuracy target, AntMan produces 5x smaller models than the state-of-art. Lastly, we show that AntMan offers super-linear speed gains compared to theoretical speedup, demonstrating its practical value on commodity hardware.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">model compression, RNN, perforamnce optimization, langugage model, machine reading comprehension, knowledge distillation, teacher-student</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Reducing computation and memory complexity of RNN models by up to 100x using sparse low-rank compression modules, trained via knowledge distillation.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SyeVNxFq27" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Good paper, but needs stronger baseline.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJgsN3R9Km&amp;noteId=SyeVNxFq27"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1482 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1482 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Model Compression is used to reduce the computational and memory complexity of DL models without significantly affecting accuracy. Existing works focused on pruning and regularization based approaches where as this paper explores structured sparsity on RNNs, using predefined compact structures.

They replace matrix-vector multiplications which is the building computational block part of RNNs, with localized group projections (LGP). where LGP divides the input and output vectors into groups where the elements of the output group is computed as a linear combination of those from the corresponding input group. Moreover, they use a permutation matrix or a dense-square matrix to combine outputs across groups. They also combine LGP with low-rank matrix decomposition in order to further reduce the computations. 

Strong points: 

Paper shows how combining the SVD and LGP can reduce computation. In particular in matrix-vector multiplications Ax, low rank reduces the computation by factorizing A into smaller matrices P and Q, while LGP reduces computation by sparsifying these matrices without changing their dimensions.

The paper discussed that their model target labels alone does not generalize well on test data and they showed teacher-student training helps greatly on retaining accuracy. They use the original uncompressed model as the teacher, and train the compressed model(student) to imitate the output distribution of the teacher, in addition to training on the target labels.

Paper is well written and easy to follow. 

This paper would be much stronger if it compared against quantization and latest pruning techniques. 

This paper replace matrix-vector multiplications with the lowRank-LGP, but they only consider RNN networks. I am wondering how it affects other models given the fact that matrix-vector multiplications is the core of many deep learning models. It is not clear why their approach should only work for RNNs.

Table 1 shows the reduction in computation and model size over the original matrix-vector multiplications Ax. I think in this analysis the computation of the those approaches are neglected. For example running the SVD alone on A (n by m matrix) takes O(m^2 n+n^3). That is true that if P and Q are given, then the cost would be n(m+n)/r. However, finding P and Q takes O(m^2 n+n^3) that could be very expensive when matrices are large.

Table 2 only shows the LGB-shuffle resuts. What about the combined SVD and LGP? Similarly in Table 4, what is the performance of the LGB-Dense?

And the model is trained using knowledge distillation. 
clarity:
I think Fig1a can be improved. Initially I don't understand how the shuffle part works. It will be more clear if the mx1 vectors have the same length and the two (m x1) labels are in the same height.
originality:
The method is quite interesting and should be interesting to many people. 
pros:
1) The method reduces computation and memory complexity at the same time.
2) The result looks impressive.  
cons:
1) Is the training of AntMan models done on GPU or CPU? How is the training time. It seems efficient implementation of the model on GPU can be challenging. 
2) It seems the modules can be used to replace any dense matrix in the neural networks. I'm not sure why it is applied on RNN only.
3) I think another baseline is needed for comparison, a directly designed small RNN model trained using knowledge distillation. In this way, we can see if the sparse low-rank compression provides new values. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1e1FpE42m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Nice idea but the experiments are quite insufficient</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJgsN3R9Km&amp;noteId=B1e1FpE42m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1482 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">29 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1482 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper presents a network compression method based on block-diagonal sparse structure for RNN. Two kinds of group mixing methods are discussed. Experiments on PTB and SQUAD have shown its superiority over ISS.
The idea present is interesting, and this paper is easy to follow. However, this paper can be improved from the following perspectives.
1.	The method of balancing the quantity of different parts in knowledge distillation is trivial. It is quite general trick.
2.	Details of experimental setup were unclear. For example, the optimization method used, the block size, and the hyper-parameters were unclear. In addition, it is also unclear how the block diagonal structure was used for the input-to-hidden weight matrix only or all weights. 
3.	In addition, the proposed method was compared with ISS only. Since there are many methods of compressing RNNs, comparison with other competitors (e.g., those presented in Related work) are necessary.  Moreover, more experiments with other tasks in addition to NLP will be better.  
4.	In Table 2, the comparison with ISS seems be unfair. The proposed methods, i.e., LGP-shuffle was obtained based on the distillation. However, ISS was trained without distillation. From Table 3, when Cmse and Ckl were set to zero, the result was much worse. The reviewer was wondering that how does ISS with distillation perform.
