class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors tackle the unsupervised domain adaptation problem by extending a previously proposed framework ADDA, as indicated in their title. The main contributions are 1) extending the adversarial discriminator in ADDA to be multiclass (distinguishing between K source classes and 1 "non-source" class), and 2) developing a new, MMD-based loss to optimize a representation against the multiclass discriminator. They demonstrate strong adaptation results on a number of standard benchmark visual domain adaptation tasks, indicating that their model is an effective improvement over existing methods.

The presentation of the method section is a bit confusing or sloppy sometimes. A few examples: near the bottom of page 3 the authors refer to $\theta_t$, though my understanding is that this should be $\theta_b$; just before Eq. 3, there is an $h_s$ that should be $h_b$; Eq. 3 needs a $k$ subscript on the log term as well. I also am curious if the authors have an explanation for why, in Eq. 2, one set of logits are divided by the temperature, while the other set remains unmodified—doesn't this mean that the discriminator $D$ is not actually an autoencoder on the source logits, as claimed?

Additionally, the authors have simultaneously proposed a number of extensions to ADDA, but have not made it clear exactly where their improvements come from. There are a number of alternative instantiations of a similar idea that seem reasonable, and from reading the paper it isn't immediately clear why the authors settled on this particular combination of methods. For example, instead of the MMD-based adversarial objective, it would have been good to see a comparison against an objective similar to that of semi-supervised GANs, i.e. train the shared encoder to maximize the sum of the first K discriminator probabilities. This seems like the most straight-forward multiclass extension to ADDA, and an exploration of how it improves over base ADDA and falls short of the proposed method would provide further intuition.

There are also a fair number of hyperparameters—in addition to the standard fare, there is also the temperature parameter $T$, the kernel bandwidths $\sigma_r$, and the dropout parameter $z$. It appears that the authors have optimized these via a hyperparameter search. However, a discussion of how sensitive the model is to these parameters is crucial, since in a truly unsupervised adaptation setting, it isn't possible to hyperparameter tune (no labeled data to evaluate performance with)!

Although the authors have demonstrated that their method is effective on standard domain adaptation tasks, the presentation of the method is a bit unclear in a number of ways, and analysis of the components of the proposed method is limited (only one baseline instantiation is explored, as opposed to a more thorough ablation), making it hard to gain a lot of insight from the proposed method.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Bkx5NRb_n7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Review</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkGb-3C5t7&amp;noteId=Bkx5NRb_n7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1144 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1144 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">In this paper, the authors improve an existing work “adversarial discriminative domain adaptation”  by (1) taking the task knowledge into account in the discriminator loss, and (2) treating discriminator as a denoising autoencoder and using MMD to minimize the distribution discrepancy between the source discriminator posterior and source encoder posterior.  Experimental studies on digits dataset and office31 dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed improvements.

Here are some comments:
(1)	More adversarial-based methods should to be discussed in the related works. Although the current work is based on ADDA, discussion only on ADDA-related works may not be sufficient. It would be more comprehensive to include more adversarial-based methods, e.g. [ref1] and [ref2]. Moreover, discussions on the difference between the proposed method and the state-of-the-art works, e.g. DIFA, would make the contribution more clear.
[ref1] Partial Adversarial Domain Adaptation, ECCV, 2018
[ref2] Incremental Collaborative and Adversarial Network for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, CVPR, 2018
(2)	Regarding step 2, why do you align the shared distribution (combing source and target) to the source? What’s the benefit of doing so to domain adaptation compared to just aligning target to the source? I notice that, in the experiments (both digits dataset and office 31 dataset), the performance of target only is comparable with that of source+target. More analysis on these results should be included. 
(3)	Regarding section 3.2.1, it is not easy to follow. I understand that the original discriminator is to confuse domain separation task. By replacing the discriminator logistic function with a K+1multi-class classifier, what the objective of this mult-class classifier is? Is it to classify multiple classes? How does this replacement align different domains? I am also unclear with the “task-specific” class and “shared” class. Better to have a clear definition. 
(4)	Regarding (2), I am wondering how the proposed method works without this loss (which means discarding L_{D1} in L_D. 
(5)	Regarding (3), it is negative log likelihood on D(h_b). Again, I am not very clear how this formulation achieves the domain alignment (as it replaces the original discriminator).
(6)	Regarding the keep probability z, how to set it? I notice that the proposed method performs differently using different z, is there any guideline to set the best z? Does the best z vary among different datasets?
(7)	The results are not significantly better than the baselines. In the digit dataset, could you give some explanation on (1) why improved 3 achieves 2.8% improvements compared with improved 2 on the first task, but achieve marginal improvement (0.9%  for the second task, and 0.3% for the third task) and even worse result (-0.5% for the last task)  on other tasks? (2) why improved 3 outperforms DIFA in the first two tasks, but is worse in the last two tasks? In the office 31 dataset, the results seem to be not state-of-the-art. I notice that JAN could achieve better results using ResNet, how about the proposed method? 

Overall, this is an interesting paper, but may not be significantly novel. The proposed method includes some new segments, but not well clarifies how each of the new segments contributes to the domain adaptation tasks. The experimental studies are not convincing as the proposed method does not significantly and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method.

In its current form, the submitted paper is very incremental and fails to deliver justifications or insights on why these specific modifications help generalization. Overall the paper is quite easy to understand, but it is written in a form focusing on what have been done by the authors rather than why these modifications should be applied. Empirically, the authors show that the proposed model achieves better results on 2 out of 4 domain adaptation experiments on digits, but without proper statistical testing it is not clear whether the improvement is significant or not. There are quite a few notations that are used without introductions and several inconsistent use of the same notations, see more details below. 

The proposed framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in this paper is the same as the original one studied in the ADDA paper. The only difference lies in the design of specific loss functions on the domain discriminators: 1). Instead of using the binary classification loss over source and target domains, the authors use the K+1 classes instead. 2). Besides the domain classification error, the authors propose to use a denoised reconstruction loss. However, despite the demonstrated improvement in the digit experiment, to me the first point does not really make sense, because intuitively in this case a large discriminative error can be caused by the confusion between the first K classes rather than by invariant representations between the source and the target. The second point is also not justified: it is not clear to me why adding a reconstruction loss on the discriminator may lead to better generalization? 

In experiments, when training the shared encoder with both instances from source and target, the selection procedure of \hat{X}_S plays an important role in the final result, but the authors didn't describe how this part is being done. 

Minor comments:
1.  In section 3, when X_S is not empty set, what's the meaning of D_B? In this case since X_S and X_T are from different distributions, how do you define D_B? 
2.  In the first paragraph of section 3, H_S is used to denote the joint distribution while in section 3.2.1 H_S is used to mean the marginal distribution. 
3.  To me a better notation for function composition is D = C_d \circ E_d rather than C_d(E_d).
4.  In section 3.1, \phi_s should be \theta_s. 
5.  In the end of section 3.2.1, \theta_t should be \theta_b.
6.  In section 3.2.2, q_s should be q_b. 
7.  In Eq. (3), for h_b, why can you have access to y_b in the unsupervised domain adaptation scenario?
8.  In Eq. (6), there is no j inside the argmax, so what's the meaning of this equation here?
