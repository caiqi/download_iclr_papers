Recently, generative methods based on GAN and VAE were developed for graphs and graph signals. However, some of these methods are complex as well as difficult to train and fine-tune. This work proposes a graph generation model that uses a recent adaptation of Mallat's scattering transform to graphs. The proposed model is naturally composed of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is a Gaussianized graph scattering transform. The decoder is a simple fully connected network that is adapted to specific tasks, such as link prediction, signal generation on graphs and full graph and signal generation. The training of our proposed system is efficient since it is only applied to the decoder and the hardware requirement is moderate. Numerical results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed system for both link prediction and graph and signal generation. These results are in contrast to experience with Euclidean data, where it is difficult to form a generative scattering network that performs as well as state-of-the-art methods. We believe that this is because of the discrete and simpler nature of graph applications, unlike the more complex and high-frequency nature of Euclidean data, in particular, of some natural images. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">graph generative neural network, link prediction, graph and signal generation, scattering network</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">This work proposes a graph generation system based on scattering and demonstrates competitive performance as well as indicates better promise of the generative scattering framework to datasets with a graph structure.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BkgwHNj93X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Simple combination of existing works</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxSBh09t7&amp;noteId=BkgwHNj93X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1539 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1539 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper used the graph scattering network as the encoder, and MLP as the decoder to generate links/graph signals/graphs.

Pros:
1.	Clearly written. Easy to follow.
2.	No need to train the encoder
3.	Good results on link prediction tasks

Cons:
1.	Lack of novelty. It is a simple combination of existing encoders and decoders. For example, compared to VGAE, the only difference in the link prediction task is using a different encoder. Even if the performance is very good, it can only demonstrate the effectiveness of others’ encoder work and this paper’s correct selection of a good encoder. 
2.	Lack of insights. As a combination of existing works, if the paper can deeply explain the why this encoder is effective for the generation, it is also beneficial. But we also do not see this part. In particular, in the graph generation task, the more important component may be the decoder to regulate the validness of the generated graphs (e.g. “Constrained Generation of Semantically Valid Graphs via Regularizing Variational Autoencoders. In NIPS 2018” which used the similar decoder but adding strong regularizations in VAE). 
3.	 Results on QM9 not good enough and lack of references. Some recent works (e.g. “Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder for Molecular Graph Generation, ICML 2018”) could already achieve 100% valid.

The authors apply the wavelet scattering transform to construct an autoencoder for graphs. They apply this architecture to reconstructing citation graphs, images, and generating molecules.

## Assessment ##

It was difficult to discern what parts of this paper were new work. The graph scattering transform seems to have appeared first in Hammond et al. or Zhou and Lerman. The proposed decoder in 3.2.1 is attributed to Kipf and Welling. The molecule generation portion was interesting, but I don't think there was enough novel content in this paper to justify acceptance to ICLR. I could be convinced otherwise if the authors' contribution is clarified in rebuttal.

## Questions and Concerns ##

* I found the definition of $S[p]f$ (page 5) a little confusing. In particular, what constitutes a 'path' $p$ in this setting?
* Can you motivate the whitening operation $A$ that is applied to the encoding? It seems like this is eliminating a lot of the information encoded in $\bar{X}$.
* I'm confused by the choice of loss function at the top of page 6. Since $D(z) = \sigma(...)$, it seems like $D(i, j)$ is meant to represent the probability of a link between $i$ and $j$. In that case, the loss is a sum of negative probabilities, which is unusual. Was this meant to be a sum of log probabilities? Also, this loss doesn't seem to account for including edges where there are none. Can you explain why this is the case?
* In section 4.2, the encoded dimension is 256 IIUC. Considering that the data was restricted to the "boots" class, the reduction from 784--&gt;256 dimensions does not seem significant. The authors concede that some high-frequency information is lost, so I wonder how their approach compares to e.g. a low-pass filter or simple compression algorithm.
* Section 4.3 states that the molecules considered are constructed from atoms C, H, O, N and F. Later, there are multiple references to only 4 atom types, one-hot vectors in $R^4$ etc. Clarify please!</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_ByeF3skShm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting paper, may lack novelty and clarity, seems to have problems in experimental evaluation.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxSBh09t7&amp;noteId=ByeF3skShm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1539 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">30 Oct 2018 (modified: 14 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1539 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span><a class="note_content_pdf item" href="/revisions?id=ByeF3skShm" target="_blank">Show Revisions</a></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary:
The paper presents a generative model for graphs which is a VAE-like architecture where the encoder is a scattering transform with fixed parameters (rather than a trainable neural net)

Pros:
+ The problem of graph generative models is very important, and a lot of the existing methods are not very scalable.
+ Using spectral methods in place of standard "neural net operations" makes a lot of sense. 
+ Numerical results for the "link prediction" task seem to be significantly better than those of baselines.

Cons: 
- The paper contains various imprecisions (see the non-exhaustive list below), and significant amount of statements which are hard to understand.
- I am not sure if the work can be considered particularly novel: in particular, it is not really emphasised what is the difference with [Angles &amp; Mallat '2018].
- The motivation for the work is not entirely clear: it is true that GANS and VAEs have their issues, but in my view it is not really explained / argued why the proposed method would solve them.
- I find the argument about the efficiency not very convincing, especially after looking at the members (bottom of p. 7): the scattering transform alone takes several orders of magnitude longer than the baseline. Authors also mention that their method does not require training of the encoder, but I do not see any comparisons with respect to number of parameters.
- The experimental evaluation for "signal generation" and "graph generation" is not very convincing. For the former there is no real comparison to existing models. And for the latter, the experimental setup seems a bit strange: it appears that the models were trained on different subsets of the dataset, making the comparison not very meaningful. Also, I would expect to see the same methods to be compared to a cross all the tasks (unless it is impossible for some reason).

Various typos / imprecisions / unclear statements:
p.1, "are complex as well as difficult to train and fine-tune.": not at all clear what this means.
p.1, "Their development is based on fruitful methods of deep learning in the Euclidean domain, such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks.": Recurrent and convolution neural network are not necessarily restricted to Euclidean domains. 
p.1, "Using a prescribed graph representation, it is possible to avoid training
the two components at the same time, but the quality of the prescribed representation is important
in order to generate promising results.": not clear what this sentence means.
p.2, "Unlike GAN or VAE, the model in this paper does not require training two components either iteratively or at the same time.": I do not see why that would necessarily be a bad thing, especially in the case of VAE where traditional training in practice corresponds to training a single neural net.
p.3, "GAN-type graph networks use a discriminator in order to compete with the generator and make its training more powerful.": I am not sure this statement is strictly correct.
p.9: "We remark that the number of molecules in the training sets are not identical to that in ...": does this mean that the models are effectively trained on different data? In that case, the comparison is not very meaningful.
