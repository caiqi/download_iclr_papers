Modeling the combinatorial label interactions in MLC has been along-haul challenge. Recurrent neural network (RNN) based encoder-decoder models have recently shown state-of-the-art performance for solving MLC. However,the sequential nature of modeling label dependencies through an RNN limits its ability in parallel computation, predicting dense labels, and providing interpretable results. In this paper, we propose Graph2Graph Networks, graph neural network models aiming to provide fast, accurate, and interpretable MLC. Graph2Graph networks replace all RNNs in the encoder-decoder architecture with graph attention mechanisms and dispense with autoregressive inference entirely. Our Graph2Graph decoder for MLC uses a modified graph attention network on an unknown and conditional graph to estimate how the labels and label interactions attend to the components of an input. Similarly, the Graph2Graph encoder adapts another graph attention network to learn representations about inputs via an unknown graph. This enables it to freely model interactions among input components and is not limited to sequential inputs. The proposed models are simple, fast, accurate, interpretable,and structure-agnostic (as long as input and output structures can each be described as graphs). Experiments on six real-world MLC datasets show the proposed models outperform autoregressive RNN models across five different metrics with a significant speedup during training and testing time.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Multi-label Classification, Graph Neural Networks, Attention, Graph Attention</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We propose Graph2Graph networks for a fast and accurate way of modelling label dependencies for multi-label classification.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1lmRDA037" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting but weaker novelty/experiments/writing</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1xYr3C5t7&amp;noteId=B1lmRDA037"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1560 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1560 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper describes an approach for using graph neural networks (GNN) to perform multi-label classification (MLC). The main idea is to use attentional pooling to project an input graph into a "label graph", whose nodes correspond to labels on some MLC problem. Multiple rounds of self-attention/message-passing hops can be performed on the input graph and label graph. Each output label is binary-valued, and is predicted from its corresponding node in the label graph. They evaluate on 6 multi-label sequence classification datasets, and report strong perform over baselines.

Though interesting, I recommend rejection for several reasons:

1) The technical contribution has limited novelty. One (very recent) reference this paper misses is "Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning with Differentiable Pooling" by Ying et al. (2018), which uses a very similar mechanism. The field is moving quickly, so references get missed sometimes, however from what I can tell, the graph-coarsening idea presented here isn't that technically distinct from Ying el al.'s. The Mrowca et al. (2018) "Flexible Neural Representation for Physics Prediction" is also fairly similar and should probably at least be cited.

2) There aren't strong baselines. This approach is based on GNNs, and the Graph2MLP results, which is similar to previous GNN graph-level classification methods, are fairly strong too. My suspicion is that with some more tuning and tweaking, the results here would be similar to those of Ying et al., Velickovic et al. (2017)'s Graph Attention Nets, and other models which use what Gilmer et al. (2017) terms the "readout" function for MLC. Without testing some of these other approaches, how can readers be sure this is approach has value over other approaches? The reviews by Gilmer et al. (2017) and Battaglia et al. (2018) summarize a bunch of alternatives that could be tried, some of which use similar encoder/decoder setups (not with the attentional pooling, however, as far as I know).

3) The writing is fairly dense for what is a fairly straightforward idea. And the paper is over 8.5 pages, with key details in the Appendix. 

I believe this approach could be quite powerful, and there was clearly a lot of excellent work that went into this project. But because the GNN area is very active, the bar is high. With a little more innovation on the model side (can the same core model be useful for things beyond MLC as well? I'm guessing it could), better baselines, better scholarship, and condensing the writing, I think this paper can be an important step forward.

Because of that I completely disagree that the proposed title of the paper is not misleading. In fact, both the input and the output of the proposed system are not graphs. Moreover, the intermediate representations are always complete graphs, so there is no graph to graph transformation here. It is the internal topology of the encoder and decoder that corresponds to a complete graph and not the nature of the processed data. 
The main intended contribution of the paper is to define a system able to capture the dependencies among input features as well as output labels, so to improve the multi-label classification task addressed by the system. This is obtained by defining a recurrent model with a complete graph topology to both encode the input and decode the output. The decoding part starts from the assumption of independence among the output labels and then, via interaction with the encoded representation of the input, eventually turns to an output where relevant statistical dependences among output labels emerge with decoding. Since both encoding and decoding are recurrent models (with no enforced guarantee to have stable points), the paper proposes to unfold the recursion for a fixed predefined number of time steps.
Presentation of the proposal is generally good, although there are some issues that are not clear. For example, the same weights indices are used for matrices belonging to the encoding and decoding, making the reader to believe that such matrices are shared. In addition, the sentence about model parameters at page 5 is a bit ambiguous and it is not sufficient to resolve the presentation problem. 
The discussion at the end of page 4 on the fact that a sequential representation for the input components is not natural is actually out of place for the specific application task selected for presentation. In fact, words in a sentence have an order. The fact that such order is lost with the bag-of-word representation is a problem of preprocessing, not of the nature of the data. In general, however, it is true that forcing an order is not natural. 
Going in the merit of the proposal, the number of parameters for the decoder scales quadratically with the number of output labels (fully connected graph). In domains with a large numbers of labels (e.g. thousands) there may be concerns on two different aspects: i) computational burden may grow significantly even if the average number of labels per item is small; ii) proper propagation of information on dependencies among labels may require to use a large value for T (graph hops), i.e. there is a dependency between size of label graph and "useful" value for T.  On this issue, by the way, figures 3 and 4 seem to report incongruent results since, because of symmetries in the model topology, equal and  reciprocal influences between input components (and output labels) would have been expected, but these are not observed in the figures. 
Analogous considerations could be done for the encoder when the size of the input is large.
Concerning experimental results, no statistical significance test is performed, so it is not clear to me if the shown improvements are actually significant. Speed-up in training and testing seem at least to give some advantage with respect to other competing approaches, however the scaling problem described above for the decoder (and encoder) may lead to much worst performances in those special cases.
The addressed problem is covered by a large literature, involving many different approaches. It would have been nice to report, for the selected datasets, the best performance (and computation times) obtained by, for example,  probabilistic graphical models or SVM-based models.
The paper seems to refer most of the relevant recent neural-based approaches.
I think the paper is relevant for ICLR (although there is no explicit analysis of the obtained hidden representations) and of interest for a good portion of attendees. 

Minor issues: 
- two rows before Section 2.2.1: \mathbb{h}_*^2  should be \mathbb{h}_*^1
- equations 4, 5, 9, 10, 14: matrices W are indexed in such a way to assume that each input word/label is associated to a different matrix (i.e., set of parameters). Is this really the case ? How is then managed the fact that different inputs may have a different number of components ? how is a specific matrix assigned to a specific word ? I guess this is a presentation mistake, otherwise there are relevant issues that are completely not addressed by the presentation.
- equation (10): since the output should be interpreted as a probability, why not using a softmax? sigmoidal units by themselves do not guarantee that the outputs sum to 1. I guess you do not have this problem because you adopt batch normalisation. This however is conceptually not nice since there is no uniformity across the dataset. Moreover, the softmax function has a nice probabilistic interpretation in the family of the exponential distributions.
- "[...] we use add a positional encoding..."
- Multi-head Attention: apart for the not so clear description, the equation involving the softmax is missing.
- "[..] the the attention and feedforward layers."
- "[..] the the sum of the total true..."

The proposed model considers the output labels as a fully connected graph where the pair-wise interaction between labels can be modelled.

Overall, although the proposed approach seems interesting, the representation of the paper needs to be improved. Below I listed some comments and suggestions about the paper.

- The proposed model did not actually use any graph structure of input and output, which can potentially mislead the readers of the paper. For instance, the encoder is just a fully connected feed-forward network with an additional attention mechanism. In the same sense, the decoder is also just a fully connected feed-forward network. Furthermore, the inputs and outputs used throughout the paper do not have any graph structure or did not use any inferred graph structure from data. I recommend using any graph-structured data to show that the proposed model can actually work with the graph-structured data (with proper graph notations) or revise the manuscript without graph2graph representation.

- I personally do not agree with the statement that the proposed model is interpretable because it can visualise the relation between labels through the attention. NN is hard to interpret because the weight structure cannot be intuitively interpretable. In the same sense, the proposed model cannot avoid the problem with the nature of black-box mechanism. Especially, multiple weight matrices are shared across the different layers, which makes it more difficult to interpret. Although the attention weights can be visualised, how can we visualise the decision process of the model from end-to-end? The question should be answered to claim that the model is interpretable.

- 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.3 shares the similar network layer construction, which can be represented as a new layer of NN with different inputs (or at least 2.2.2 and 2.3 have the same layer structure). It would be better to encapsulate these explanations into a new NN module which can be reused multiple parts of the manuscript for a concise explanation.

- Although the network claims to model the interactions between labels, the final prediction of labels are conditionally independent to each other, whereas the energy based models such as SPEN models the structure of output directly. In that sense, the model does not take into account the structure of output when the prediction is made although the underlying structure seems to model the 'pair-wise' interaction between labels.

- In Table1, if the bold-face is used to emphasise the best outcome, I found it is inconsistent with the result (see the output of delicious and tfbs datasets).

- Is it more natural to explain the encoder first followed by the decoder?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
