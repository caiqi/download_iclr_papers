Utility providers are also becoming more interested in guaranteeing data privacy. Therefore, users and providers can and should collaborate in privacy protecting challenges, and this paper addresses this new paradigm. We propose a framework where the user controls what characteristics of the data they wants to share (utility) and what they want to keep private (secret), without necessarily asking the utility provider to change its existing machine learning algorithms. We first analyze the space of privacy-preserving representations, and derive natural information-theoretic bounds on the utility-privacy trade-off when disclosing a sanitized version of the data X. We present explicit architectures to learn privacy-preserving representations that approach this bound in a data-driven fashion. We then describe important use-case scenarios where the utility providers are willing to collaborate, at least partially, with the sanitization process. In this setting, we limit the possible sanitization functions to space-preserving transformations, meaning the sanitation maps the data to the same space as the original data, and the utility provider can then use the exact same (existing) algorithm for the original and sanitized data, a novel critical attribute to help service providers to collaborate. We illustrate this framework and show how we can maintain utility while protecting secret information even in cases where the joint distribution of the data X and the utility and secret variables U and S are unknown; and where the difficulty of inferring the utility variable U is much higher than the task of inferring the secret variable S. This is done through the implementation of three use cases; subject-within-subject, where we tackle the problem of having an identity detector (from facial images) that works only on a consenting subset of users, an important application, for example, for mobile devices activated by face recognition, helping them to become private to the environment instead of always ``listening as they currently act; gender-and-subject, where we want to preserve facial verification (hard) while hiding the gender attribute (easy) for users who choose to do so; and emotion-and-gender, where we tackle the issue of hiding independent variables, as is the case of hiding gender while preserving emotion detection. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Machine learning, privacy, adversarial training, information theory, data-driven privacy</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Learning privacy-preserving transformations from data.

The paper shows an information theoretic bound on the privacy loss and derives a loss function for the privatizer to use. It then proposes an algorithm for the privatizer, evaluates its performance on three scenarios.

The paper investigated on an interesting problem and proposed a nice solution for synthetic data generation. However, I think the proposed framework and how the example scenarios fit into the framework needs to be described clearer. And more experimental evaluations would also help make the result more solid.

More detailed comments:
- Do the user and privatizer need to know what the machine learning task is when doing the sanitization? Is it ok for the privatizer to define utility in a different way as the machine learning task? For example, as a user, I may want to hide my emotion, but I’m ok with publishing my gender and age. In this case, can I use a privatizer which defines secret as gender and utility as (gender, age)? And will the synthetic data generated by such a privatizer be equally useful for a gender classifier (or an age classifier)? It would be good if it is, as we don’t need to generate task-specific synthetic data then.
- I think it might be interesting to see the effect of the privatizer when utility and secrecy are correlated (with a potentially different level of correlation). 
- It’s not clear to me where the privatizer comes into the picture in the subject-within-subject example. It seems like users here are people whose face appear in front of the mobile device, so they probably won’t be able to privatize their face image, yet the device won’t be able to tell if users are in the consenting group without looking at their faces. I think it’s better if more clarification on how each of the three scenarios fits into the proposed framework is provided.
- Can different user have different secret? 
- In the experiment, it might be better to try different models/algorithms for the utility and secrecy inferring algorithm, to demonstrate how the privatizer protects secrecy under different scenarios.
- I think there might be some related work on the field of fairness and transparency where we sometimes want the machine learning models to learn without looking at some sensitive features. It would be nice to add more related work on that side. 
- It’s better to give more intuition and explanation than formulas in Section 3. 
- There are a few typos (e.g. Page2, 3rd paragraph, last sentence: “out”-&gt; “our”; Equation (4), I(S, Q) should be I(S; Q)?; Page 8, 2nd paragraph, 1st line “Figures in 5” -&gt; “Figure 5”) that need to be addressed. Texts in some figures, like Figure 2 and 3, might be enlarged.

Informally, it is expected from the transformed output of data record, one should be able to learn about a desired hidden variable, but should not be able to learn anything about a sensitive hidden variable. To that end, the paper proposes a KL divergence based privacy notion, and an algorithmic approach to learn a representation while balancing the utility privacy trade-off.

I am excited about the choice of the problem, but I have reservations about the treatment of privacy in the paper. First, KL divergence is a very weak (average case) notion privacy that can be easily broken. Second, the algorithm that is outlined in the paper gives an empirical way to compute the representation while balancing the utility-privacy trade-off (Eq. 6). However, there is no formal privacy guarantee for the algorithm. It is important to remember that unlike the utility, privacy is a worst-case notion and should formally hold in all occasions.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Syxle0BY3Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting ideas, some major practical limitations</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJe2so0qF7&amp;noteId=Syxle0BY3Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper660 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper660 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">[Summary] The authors consider a problem related to de-identification, where the goal is to perturb a dataset X in a way that makes it possible to infer some useful information U about each example in the dataset while obscuring some sensitive information S. For example, the authors consider the problem of perturbing pictures of people's faces to obfuscate the subjects' emotions while making it possible to infer their genders. The concrete approach explored in the paper's experimental evaluation ensures that an existing model trained model on the original dataset will continue to work when applied to the perturbed data.

On the theory side, the authors derive information-theoretic lower bounds on the extent to which one can disclose useful information about a dataset without leaking sensitive information, and propose concrete minimization problems that can perturb the data to trade off between the two objectives. On the practical side, the authors evaluate the minimization setup on three different problems.

[Key Comments] I'm of two minds about this paper. On the whole, I found the problem statement compelling. However, I had serious reservations about the implementation. First: I had trouble understanding the experimental setup based on the limited information provided in Section 5, and the results seem difficult to reproduce from the information in the paper. Second and more seriously: the security guarantees provided in practice seem very weak. At the very least, the authors should check whether their perturbations are robust against an adversary who retrains their model from scratch on perturbed data. This experiment would significantly strengthen the submission, but would still leave open the possibility that a clever adversary could extract more sensitive information than expected from the perturbed data.

[Details]
[Pro #1] The idea of perturbing an input in order to optimize bounds on how much "useful" versus "secret" information is disclosed by the output seems intuitively appealing. In that context, the theory from Sections 2 and 3 seems well-motivated. Section 3.2 ("defining a trainable loss metric") is especially well-motivated. It provides a concrete objective function which, when minimized, can obfuscate data in a way that trades off between utility and secrecy.

[Pro #2] The idea of perturbing a dataset in a way that allows existing useful algorithms to continue working without modifications seems like an interesting and novel contribution. I found the following excerpt from the introduction especially compelling: "it is important to design collaborative systems where each user shares a sanitized version of their data with the service provider in such a way that user-defined non-sensitive tasks can be performed but user-defined sensitive ones cannot, without the service provider requiring to change any data processing pipeline otherwise."

[Pro #3] The paper combines theoretical results with empirical case studies on three different problems. Based on visual inspection, the outputs of the perturbation heuristics shown in Section 5 / Figure 3 and Figure 4 seem reasonable.

[Con #1] Few details are provided about the experimental setup used in Section 5, and it was difficult for me to understand how the theoretical results in Section 4 were actually being applied. There's typically a lot of work that goes into turning a theoretical objective function (e.g., Equation 10 in Section 4.2) into a practical experimental setup. This could be a major contribution of the paper. But right now, I feel like there aren't enough details about the implementation for me to reproduce the experiments.

[Con #2] I had trouble understanding the motivation for the Subject within Subject case study in Section 5.1. The authors describe the problem as follows: "Imagine a subset of users wish to unlock their phone using facial identification, while others opt instead to verify their right to access the phone using other methods; in this setting, we would wish the face identification service to work only on the consenting subset of users, but to respect the privacy of the remaining users." The proposed solution (Figure 3) applies minor perturbations to the pictures of consenting subjects while editing the photos of the non-consenting users to leave only their silhouettes. A simple baseline would be to remove the photos of the non-consenting users from the dataset entirely. The case study would greatly benefit from a discussion of why the baseline is insufficient. It's also perfectly reasonable to say that the section is meant as a way to check whether the objective function from Section 4 can lead to reasonable behavior in practice, but if so, the intent should be clarified.

[Con #3] As far as I can tell, the practical experiments in Section 5 assume that the party who perturbs the dataset knows exactly what algorithm an attacker will use to infer secret information. They also seem to assume that the attacker cannot switch to a different algorithm -- or even retrain an existing machine-learned model -- to try and counter the perturbation heuristics. From the beginning of Section 5: "Initially, we assume that the secret algorithm is not specifically tailored to attack the proposed privatization, but instead is a robust commonly used algorithm trained on raw data to infer the secret." Unless I missed something, it seems like this assumption is used throughout the experimental evaluation.

To the authors' credit, the submission states this assumption explicitly in Section 5. From a security perspective, however, this seems like a dangerous assumption to rely on, as it leaves "sanitized" data vulnerable to attacks. For example, an attacker with knowledge of the perturbation algorithm can retrain the model they use to extract sensitive information, using perturbed images in place of the original images in their training dataset.

My main practical concern is that the security guarantees provided by the submission seem fragile. It may be much easier to build a perturbation algorithm that is resistant to a single (known) attack than to remove the sensitive information from the dataset entirely. Right now, the empirical results in the submission seem to focus on the former.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
