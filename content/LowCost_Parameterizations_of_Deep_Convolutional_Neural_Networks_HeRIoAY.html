Commonly, the convolution operators couple features from all channels.
For wide networks, this leads to immense computational cost in the training of and prediction with CNNs.
In this paper, we present novel ways to parameterize the convolution more efficiently, aiming to decrease the number of parameters in CNNs and their computational complexity.
We propose new architectures that use a sparser coupling between the channels and thereby reduce both the number of trainable weights and the computational cost of the CNN.
Our architectures arise as new types of residual neural network (ResNet) that can be seen as discretizations of a Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and thus have predictable theoretical properties. Our first architecture involves a convolution operator with a special sparsity structure, and is applicable to a large class of CNNs. Next, we present an architecture that can be seen as a discretization of a diffusion reaction PDE, and use it with three different convolution operators. We outline in our experiments that the proposed architectures,  although considerably reducing the number of trainable weights, yield comparable accuracy to existing CNNs that are fully coupled in the channel dimension.

The particular architectures presented are motivated by their superficial resemblance to a Reaction-Diffusion model.

The attempt to connect the work in this paper with Reaction-Diffusion models, or with PDEs in general, is very poorly executed.  Explaining the low cost convolution operators in terms of RD models in Section 3 involves the use of non-standard notation, which makes the paper much more difficult to follow than necessary.

An unusual presentation could be justified if the connection to RD models were exploited in some useful way, but that does not seem to be the case here.  The only place the PDE connection is essential is in the definition of the implicit RD architecture, but according to table 2 this architecture appears to underperform the explicit RD architecture across the board.

The first sentence of Section 3.2.2 implies that the motivating theory suggests that the implicit architecture should outperform its explicit counterpart.  The fact that it convincingly does not do so draws the applicability of the motivation into question.

The proposed architectures achieve worse performance than the MobileNet baseline in almost all cases. In many cases the drop in performance is marginal but it is quite consistent.  The timing comparison would be more compelling if it also included a runtime comparison for some full architectures.

These new parameterizations of CNN like architectures limit the coupling between the parameters in order to achieve this reduction. The inspiration for these new parametrization comes from analogies between the functional form of ResNet modules and numerical schemes for solving reaction diffusion PDEs.  Experiments are performed on image classification benchmarks (CIFAR, STL).

Both the organization and the technical writing of the paper are poor.  Notations are often confusing, the technical part is not detailed nor motivated enough. There is almost nothing on the related  work.

Concerning the content, the paper builds on the PDE inspired NNs topic, focusing on CNNs and on a specific form of PDE, reaction-diffusion equations.  This is an interesting topic with recent publications. 
Before developing the PDE aspect, the authors present a first method decoupling the classical convolution into a series of two operations. This decomposition is used later, but is not directly related to the main topic of the paper. This is very close to ref (Howard 2017) and the difference with their method should be highlighted.

The main equation providing the link with reaction diffusion equation is eq. (8).  The interpretation provided here is not satisfactory and this should be motivated and formulated in more details. From what I understand, the analogy with reaction simply comes because the second term in eq. (8) is a function of all the input variables and the one with diffusion comes from the fact that convolutions perform a local linear spatial operation so that a convolution could probably be interpreted as a differential operator. Is there an analogy with the Laplacian used in R&amp;D equations? Even if one could interpret a convolution as a differential operator, there should be terms of different orders there. Said otherwise, this expression may have the potential to represent a reaction-diffusion equation, but also other functional components and there is no reason why it should be a reaction-diffusion form.
Considering the stability argument in eq. (11), a part of the Jacobian is missing, the one relative to the second term, could you explain?
The circulant method has already been used in CNNs by some authors together with a FFT implementation, what is new here? (see some ref. below).
Then the performance of the proposed methods are close to the MobileNet reference baseline , but the best two methods seem to be this baseline and the closely related method denoted LinearMix in the table. The PDE inspired algorithms are usually below these two methods. Could you comment on that? 
In fig. 1, you did not compare neither with mobileNet nor with a FFT implementation of a ResNet. Why?
Finally, one of the arguments advocated in the paper is the importance of classical stability results for PDEs, but this not developed.

Pro : the topic is timely and some of the arguments might lead to  interesting developments.
Cons : both the form and the technical content need to be revised. The technical part is not developed enough.

However, many existing works, not only the papers mentioned by the authors, but also other ones, including [1, 2, 3] listed below, have investigated this topic and proposed many different network architectures based on this understanding. For example, in [1, 2, 3], authors also proposed a DCT based parameterization scheme for convolution operator and FFT is also considered to speed up the computation. Thus I think the proposed idea is a little bit incremental. 

As for the particular parameterization schemes, I am afraid the idea is somehow handcraft and thus it is not very clear why the proposed diagonal and circulant operator can properly approximate the original convolution architecture, especially from theoretical side. Authors have claimed that one may borrow theoretical investigation from PDE to address this issue. However, I believe this is definitely not a trivial work. For example, the stability properties of PDE are mostly built on based specific formulation and discretization of PDEs. But the proposed architectures definitely not fit these assumptions. Thus transferring existing theoretical results in PDE area to the proposed scheme is not a straightforward work.  

For the experimental part, I am afraid the results are also weak. For example, please notice that many works have proposed schemes to simplify the network architectures. I believe authors should compare more existing works to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed one. Also, I suggest authors to demonstrate the proposed schemes on not only high-level, but also low-level vision tasks. This is because the reaction diffusion based architectures have been widely used in these areas, such as [3].
