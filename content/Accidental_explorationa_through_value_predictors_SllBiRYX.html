Comments: The language and the structure of the paper are not on a very good scientific level. The paper should be proofread as it contains a lot of grammatical mistakes. 

Given the assumption that every state's reward is fixed, the theoretical analysis is trivial.

The comparison of policy gradient methods is too old. The authors should look for more advanced methods to compare.

The experimental environment is very simple in reinforcement learning tasks, and the authors should look for more complex environments for comparison. The experiment results are hard to interpret. 



Q1: In the theoretical analysis, why should the rewards for each state be fixed?

Q2:Why use r_t – (V(s_t)-\gammaV(s_{t+1})) as the advantage function?

Q3: What does the “variant” mean in all figures?

The scope is right for ICLR. 

The presentation is pretty good as far as the English goes but suffers from serious problems on the level of formulating concepts. Overall, I believe that the issue addressed by the paper is important, but I am not sure whether the approach taken by the authors addresses it.

I have the following complaints.
1. The paper suffers from a fundamental confusion about what problem it is trying to address. There are two straightforward ways to formulate the problem. First, we can formulate the task as solving an MDP with infinite trajectories and ask the question of what we can learn training from finite ones. The learned policies would then be evaluated on the original MDP (in practice using trajectories that are, say, an order of magnitude longer or, for a simple MDP, analytically). Second, we can consider the family of episodic MDPs parametrised by trajectory length T and ask the question of what we can learn by training on some values of T and evaluating on others. These problems are similar, but not the same and should be carefully distinguished. Right now, the introduction reads like the authors were trying to use the first approach but Section 4 reads like they are doing the second: "If during training we just used times up to T, but deployed the agent in an environment with times greater than T". Either way, the concept of bias, which appears throughout the paper, isn't formally defined anywhere. I believe that a paper that claims to address bias should have an equation that defines it as a difference between two clearly defined quantities. It should also be clearly and formally distinguished which quantities are deterministic and which are random variables. The introduction seems to (implicitly?) define bias as a random variable, section 3.1 seems to talk about "bias introduced by initializing the network". As the paper stands now, the working definition of bias used by the authors seems to be that some quantity is vaguely wrong. I do expect a higher standard of clarity in a scientific paper,

2. The paper confounds the problem of learning the value function, specifying the initial estimates of the value function and exploration. The analysis of exploration is entirely informal and suffers from the lack of clear problem formulation as per (1). Of course, one can influence exploration by initialising the value function in various ways, and this may respond differently to different truncations (different values of T), but I don't see how it is related to the "bias" problem that the paper is trying to address. In any case, I wish the authors either provided a formal handle on exploration or shift the focus of the paper and remove it,

3. I don't see what hypothesis the experiments are trying to test. Clearly, if I train my agent on a different MDP and test it on a different one, I get a mismatch. The lack of clear definitions as per (1) comes back with a vengeance.

4. Section 1.1 seems to exist purely to create a spurious impression of formality, which bears little relevance for what the paper is actually about. RL, as traditionally formulated, uses discrete time-steps so the Brownian motion model developed in this section doesn't seem very applicable - it is true that it is a limiting case of a family of discrete chains, but I don't see how this produces any insights about RL - chains are easy to simulate, so why not test on a chain directly? In any case, the result shown in Section 1.1 is entirely standard, can be found in any textbook on stochastic processes and was likely introduced purely to cover for the lack on any substantial theory that comes form the authors.

To summarize: if the authors address these points, there is a possibility that the ideas presented in this draft may somehow lead to a paper at some later point. However, I feel that the required changes would be pretty massive and don't see how the authors could make it during the ICLR revision phase - the problems aren't details or technicalities but touch the very substance of what the paper is trying to do. Basically, the whole paper would need to be re-written.

another minor point:  sloppy capitalization in section 2.1

Summary:

The paper attempts to link the known mismatch between infinite horizon MDP values and finite trajectory sums to the problem of exploration.  Trajectories in environments requiring exploration (mountain car and a number-line walk) are shown and the effects of changing trajectory lengths and initial values are discussed.  Potential solutions to the problem are proposed though the authors did not deem any of the solutions satisfactory.


Review:

The paper brings up a number of important issues in empirical reinforcement learning and exploration, but fails to tackle them in a manner that convincingly isolates the problem nor proposes a solution that seems to adequately address the issue.  Specifically, several issues seem to be studied at once here (including finite-horizon MDPs, function approximation, and exploration), relevant work from the exploration and RL community is not cited, the early experiments do not reach a formal theoretical claim, and the proposed solutions do not appear to adequately address the problem).  These issues are detailed below.

First, the paper is considering many different issues and biases at once, including those introduced by initialization of the value function, exploration policies, function approximation, and finite/infinite length trajectories.  While the authors claim in several places that they show one bias is more important than another, no definitive experiment or theorem is given showing that finite-length trajectories are the cause of bad behavior.  While it is well known that infinite-horizon MDPs do not exactly match value functions for finite horizon MDPs, so many other factors are included in the current work (for instance the use of neural networks) that it remains unclear that the finite/infinite mismatch is an issue.

The paper also fails to cite much of the relevant work on these topics.  For instance, the use of infinite-horizon MDPs to study finite learning trajectories is often done under the guise of epsilon-optimal guarantees, with  epsilon derived from the discount factor (see “Near-Optimal Reinforcement Learning in Polynomial Time”).  In addition, the effects shown in mountain car when changing the values or the initialization function, mirror experiments with Q-learning that have shown that there is no one initialization scheme that guarantees optimal exploration (see Strehl’s thesis “Probably Approximate Correct Exploration in Reinforcement Learning” ).  Overall, the paper seems to confuse the problems of value initialization and trajectory length and does not show that they are particularly related.

In addition, the early sections covering theoretical models such as Wiener Processes and Random Walks lay out many equations but do not come to a specific formally proven point.  No theorem or proof is given that compactly describes which exact problem the authors have uncovered.  Therefore, when the solutions are presented, it remains unclear if any of them actually solve the problem.

Finally, several of the references are only ArXiv pre-prints.  Papers submitted to ICLR or other conferences and journals should only cite papers that have been peer-reviewed unless absolutely necessary (e.g. companion papers).
