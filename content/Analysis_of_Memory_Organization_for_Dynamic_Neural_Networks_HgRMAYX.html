This analysis helps to open the dynamic neural network' black box from the memory usage prospective. Accordingly, a taxonomy for these networks and their variants is proposed and proved using a unifying architecture. With the taxonomy, both network architectures and learning tasks are classified into four classes. And a one-to-one mapping is built between them to help practitioners select the appropriate architecture. To exemplify each task type, four synthetic tasks with different memory requirements are developed. Moreover, we use two natural language processing applications to apply the methodology in a realistic setting. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">memory analysis, recurrent neural network, LSTM, neural Turing machine, neural stack, differentiable neural computers</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1gP7OO5h7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Very interesting consolidation paper on the analysis of dynamic neural networks</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1gRM2A5YX&amp;noteId=H1gP7OO5h7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1314 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1314 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">I really liked this paper and believe it could be useful to many practitioners of NLP, conversational ML and sequential learning who may find themselves somewhat lost in the ever-expanding field of dynamic neural networks.

Although the format of the paper is seemingly unusual (it may feel like reading a survey at first), the authors propose a concise and pedagogical presentation of Jordan Networks, LSTM, Neural Stacks and Neural RAMs while drawing connections between these different model families.

The cornerstone of the analysis of the paper resides in the taxonomy presented in Figure 5 which, I believe, should be presented on the front page of the paper. The taxonomy is justified by a thorough theoretical analysis which may be found in appendix.

The authors put the taxonomy to use on synthetic and real data sets. Although the data set taxonomy is less novel it is indeed insightful to go back to a classification of grammatical complexity and structure so as to enable a clearer thinking about sequential learning tasks. 

An analysis of sentiment analysis and question answering task is conducted which relates the properties of sequences in those datasets to the neural network taxonomy the authors devised. In each experiment, the choice of NN recommended by the taxonomy gives the best performance among the other elements presented in the taxonomy.

Strength:
o) The paper is thorough and the appendix presents all experiments in detail. 
o) The taxonomy is clearly a novel valuable contribution. 
o) The survey aspect of the paper is also a strength as it consolidates the reader's understanding of the families of dynamic NNs under consideration.

Weaknesses:
o) The taxonomy presented in the paper relies on an analysis of what the architectures can do, not what they can learn. I believe the authors should acknowledge that the presence of Long Range Dependence in sequences is still hard to capture by dynamic neural networks (in particular RNNs) and that alternate analysis have been proposed to understand the impact of the presence of such Long Range Dependence in the data on sequential learning. I believe that mentioning this issue along with older (<a href="http://ai.dinfo.unifi.it/paolo/ps/tnn-94-gradient.pdf)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ai.dinfo.unifi.it/paolo/ps/tnn-94-gradient.pdf)</a> and more recent (e.g. http://proceedings.mlr.press/v84/belletti18a/belletti18a.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00144.pdf) papers on the topic is necessary for the paper to present a holistic view of the matter at hand.
o) The arguments given in 5.2 are not most convincing and could benefit from a more thorough exposition, in particular for the sentiment analysis task. It is not clear enough in my view that it is true that "since the goal is to classify the emotional tone as either 1 or 0, the specific contents of the text are not very important here". One could argue that a single word in a sentence can change its meaning and sentiment.
o) The written could be more polished.

As a practitioner using RNNs daily I find this paper exciting as an attempt to conceptualize both data set properties and dynamic neural network families. I believe that the authors should address the shortcomings I think hinder the paper's arguments and exposition of pre-existing work on the analysis of dynamic neural networks.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SkeykfvchX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Useful taxomony of memory-based neural network</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1gRM2A5YX&amp;noteId=SkeykfvchX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1314 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1314 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary
=========
The paper analyses the taxonomy over memory-based neural networks, in the decreasing order of capacity: Neural RAM to Neural Stack, Neural Stack to LSTM and LSTM to vanilla RNN. The experiments with synthetic and NLP datasets demonstrate the benefits of using models that fit with task types.  

Comment
========
Overall, the paper is well written and presents interesting analysis of different memory architectures. However, the contribution is rather limited. The proposed taxonomy is not new. It is a little bit obvious and mentioned before in [1] (Unfortunately, this was not cited in the manuscript). The theorems on inclusion relationship are also obvious and the main contribution of the paper is to formally show that in mathematical forms.  The experiments on synthetic tasks give some insights into the modelsâ€™ operations, yet similar analyses can be found in [2, 3]. To verify the models really learn the task, the authors should include tests on unseen sequence lengths.  There remains questions unexplained in NLP tasks such as why multi-slot memory did not show more advantages in Movie Review and why Neural Stack performed worse than LSTM in bAbI data.  

Minor potential errors: 

In Eq. (6), r_{t-1} should be r_t   

The LSTM presented in Section 3.2 is not the common one. Normally, there should be x_t term in Eq. (3) and h_t=g_{o,t}*\tanh(r_t) in Eq. (6). The author should follow the common LSTM formulas (which may lead to different proofs) or include reference to their LSTM version.

They propose some reductions to imply how one model can be used (or modify) to simulate another. They then make predictions about which type of models should be best on different types of tasks.

Unfortunately I did not find the paper particularly well written and the taxonomy was not illuminating for me. I actually felt, in the endeavor of creating a simple taxonomy the authors have created confusing simplifications, e.g.

"LSTM: state memory and memory of a single external event"

to me is mis-leading as we know an LSTM can compress many external events into its hidden units. Furthermore the taxonomy did not provide me with any new insights or display a prediction that was actually clairvoyant. I.e. it was clear from the outset that a memory network (say) will be much better at bAbI than a stack-augmented neural network. It would be more interesting to me, for example, if the paper could thus formalize why NTMs &amp; DNCs (say) do not outperform LSTMs at language modeling, for example. I found the reductions somewhat shady, e.g. the RAM simulation of a stack is possible, however the model could only learn the proposed reduction if the number of write heads was equal to the number of memory slots --- or unless it had O(N) thinking steps per time step, where N is the number of memory slots, so it's not a very realistic reduction. You would never see a memory network, for example, simulating a stack due to the fixed write-one-slot-per-timestep interface. 

Nit: I'm not sure the authors should be saying they 'developed' four synthetic tasks, when many of these tasks have previously been proposed and published (counting, copy, reverse copy). </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">2: Strong rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
