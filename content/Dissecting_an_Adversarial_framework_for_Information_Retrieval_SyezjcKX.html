IRGAN attempts to leverage the framework for Information-Retrieval (IR), a task that can be described as modeling the correct conditional probability distribution p(d|q) over the documents (d), given the query (q). The work that proposes IRGAN claims that optimizing their minimax loss function will result in a generator which can learn the distribution, but their setup and baseline term steer the model away from an exact adversarial formulation, and this work attempts to point out certain inaccuracies in their formulation. Analyzing their loss curves gives insight into possible mistakes in the loss functions and better performance can be obtained by using the co-training like setup we propose, where two models are trained in a co-operative rather than an adversarial fashion.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">GAN, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Points out problems in loss function used in IRGAN, a recently proposed GAN framework for Information Retrieval.

Specifically the paper claims that (unlike regular GANs and what was likely intended by the authors or IRGAN) the discriminator and generator are working against each other. The paper then aims to show a couple of more well-founded different (generator-free) setups that perform about as well (if not better) as the original IRGAN work.

Overall I found the work to be quite interesting and the findings to be illuminating. That said I think the paper notably lacked rigor and depth which definitely hurt the quality of the paper.

Below are my thoughts on the different facets as well as more detailed strengths / weaknesses breakdown:

Quality: Above average
As mentioned I think some of the findings are illuminating and thus overage the paper scores well on this aspect.

Clarity: Slightly above average
While the paper is largely easy to follow, there are certain key sections that are not well explained / have fundamental errors.

Originality: Strong

Significance: Little below average
My (main) concern here with this work is that the missing rigor and depth of the work is what is needed for readers to have a deeper understanding of the fundamental issue so as to be able to rectify it in future works.

---

Strengths / Things I liked about the work:

+ The topic / theme of the work: I believe as a community we should encourage more such works that take a critical deep dive into recently proposed methods that may have some inherent weaknesses. As the authors noted the IRGAN work has become quite popular despite some of these (previously unknown) issues.

+ The experimental results in general do a fair job illustrating the likely issue (though I would have liked to see more rigor and depth here as well as detailed below)

Weaknesses / Things that concerned me:

- (W1) Lacking rigor / depth: One of my big concerns with this work is that the analysis to demonstrate the inherent flaws of IRGAN if fairly shallow and not detailed enough. For example, Section 5 (which should have been the key section of the work) is quite poorly written and not rigorous enough. Claiming that log(1-z) can be replaced with - log(z) is incorrect -- how can this substitution be made as is?

Overall my sense after reading the work is that I understand that the IRGAN formulation is not completely well-formed in terms of discriminator/generator synergy (the pairwise formulation has the additional issue of separating real pairs rather than higher rank-lower rank pairs). However I do not buy that the generator and discriminator directly oppose each other as is claimed in the work (I believe this arises only due to the incorrect claim that log(1-z) can be replaced with -log(z)).

Thus at the end of the day I feel the reader is willing to buy there is a issue with the formulation, but they do not fully understand it not do they understand enough to understand how to rectify the underlying issues. To me that was unfortunate as the paper would have been an excellent work if it had done so.

- (W2) Missing some experimental results / deeper insights : There were some notable empirical results that were missing or not provided, that raised some concerns in my mind. For instance I don't see the co-training approach listed for the MovieLens dataset .. Why so? The authors make a secondary claim that they are able to improve upon IRGANs via their proposed approach but then they do not substantiate these on all the datasets which seems like a notable oversight.

 - (W3) Missing details: To add to the above I think the authors can clearly be more detailed in describing for instance the models for D, G, p_\psi etc .. Right now I can speculate what they are but I don't think a reader should be expected to speculate in such cases. Likewise empirical details about the datasets and their sizes could easily have been added.

Also the paper presents the IRGAN pairwise approach and mentions pairs in a couple of places but I don't see an approach that can learn from pairs among the ones proposed.

Another example is the two proposed models Fig 2a (Only discriminator) vs Fig 2b (cotraining). I don't see an explanation or intuition for why 2b is expected to be better than 2a. Given the claims of the work I would have wanted to understand this better.

- (W4) Significance testing: This is an important experimental process to understand the validity of some of the claims. While I understand it is not the main claim of the paper, understand the significance of these differences helps put things in perspective. I would strongly urge the authors to add this for all of their experimental results not just the ones the proposed models are outperformed by IRGANs.

- Lastly I would urge the authors to be rigid and clear in their notations. For example in the equation in section 4.5, "o'" occurs out of nowhere.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Syg60A2OhQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>This paper points out the limitation of IRGAN but it  is better to submit to SIGIR.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syez3j0cKX&amp;noteId=Syg60A2OhQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper688 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper688 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper is closely related to the SIGIR 2017 paper “IRGAN: A minimax game for unifying generative and discriminative information retrieval models”. The SIGIR paper proposed a Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) model for Information Retrieval (IRGAN). And in this paper, the authors dissect the IRGAN model and figure out that the discriminator and generator of IRGAN are optimizing directly opposite loss functions. They also provide experimental studies and show that the superiority of IRGAN in the experiments are mainly because of the discriminator maximizing the likelihood of the real data and not because of the generator.  
Strong Points:
Considering that the IRGAN becomes popular after it being published, I should say the analyzing of this paper is important for researchers in the IR domain.

Concerns or Suggestions:
1.	Except the analyzing on IRGAN, the contribution of this paper is limited. Most of the parts of this paper introduce GAN and IRGAN. Only Section 5 focuses on the analyzing. The methods claimed new proposed, Single Discriminator and Co-training, are good for supporting the analyzing but they are not quite novel.
2.	It is strange to introduce the two models, Single Discriminator and Co-training in the experimental setting section. I would suggest to separate them out and introduce them earlier.
3.	The topic of this paper is more related to the IR domain. It will be better to publish it in SIGIR, together with the IRGAN paper.
4.	Besides, if it is possible, I would suggest researchers who have direct experiences on the implement and study on IRGAN give more comments on this paper. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJeFkJ9D2Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Good idea, but paper suffers on many important points</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syez3j0cKX&amp;noteId=HJeFkJ9D2Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper688 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper688 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper trains an information retrieval (IR) model by contrasting the joint query-document distributions, p(q, d) with negative samples drawn from a resampling of the product of marginals, p(q) x p(d). They use a second discriminator to provide the re-weighting (I believe picking to top negative sample from the other model) and train this other model in a way that mirrors the first. They also attempt to point out some theoretical problems with a competing model, IRGAN, which uses a generator that is trying to model the joint.

While I like the proposal idea, I think the paper has too many problems to warrant publication. First, the story is very disappointing. The authors phrase most of the paper as a critique of IRGAN, but this critique falls short. Really this is more of a paper about where to get negative samples when training a model of the joint (or the log-ratio in this case). Using negative samples from real data with noise contrastive estimation [1] is found in numerous works in NLP [2][3], and has gained some recent attention in the context of representation learning [4][5]. The first algorithm proposed is essentially doing a sort of ranking loss on negative samples, which mirrors similar works [6]. In fact, the generator in IRGAN could be viewed as just a parametric / adaptive negative sampling distribution in the context of NCE for the ultimate purpose of learning an estimate of the log-ratio. The most interesting thing I think of this work here is the co-training, i.e., using another model to help re-sample, and I think this idea should be explored in more detail.

Second, the paper spends far too much time revisiting prior work than addressing their own model, doing more analysis, providing more insight.

Third, the paper is just poorly written. The notation is confusing, some of the equations are unclear (I have no idea how "r" is used in any of this), and the arguments of the baseline in IRGAN don't really doesn't make any sense.

Notes:
P1
I don't really follow why IRGAN is so central to this work. Good ideas aren't difficult to motivate, especially if empirically everything works out.
P2
I'm having trouble with claims, especially more recently, about GAN instability, particularly since numerous approaches [7][8] seem to have more or less solved the problem.

The use of "|" in G is awfully confusing.
P3
Almost 2 pages of unnecessary background

P4
Why are we using "|" in functions? What's wrong with ","?
theta = \theta
I don't understand the point of the quote (in italics).
What happened to "r" in all of this?
The last two equations and their relationship could be more clear.

You use italics, so is this supposed to be a quote? But then you have a section which attempts to show this.
P5
I have no idea what's supposed to be going on in 5). The samples from the real joint don't factor in the generator gradient, or at least it's absolutely not clear that this pops out of the baseline? Then you switch from log (1 - x) to - log x and there's some claim about this violating the adversarial objective?

It took me more than a few reads to figure out what the equation at the bottom of P5 is doing: is this resampling? It's fairly unclear.
