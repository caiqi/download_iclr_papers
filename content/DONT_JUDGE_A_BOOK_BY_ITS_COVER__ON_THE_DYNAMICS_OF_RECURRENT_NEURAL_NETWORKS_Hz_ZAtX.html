are required to perform data processing as well as to keep track of past events
by creating memories. Consequently RNNs are harder to train than their not recurrent
counterparts. In this paper, we investigate the representation of memories
formed in trained RNN internal state under various training protocols. It is not
clear whether there is a trade-off between learning discriminative task, learning
actions and learning to memorize. Having observed the RNN’s apparently consistent
performance regardless of training protocol, we expected the internal dynamics
to be similar as well. Instead we were surprised to discover substantial
differences, leading to differences in the ability to generalize for unforeseen tasks
or conditions. In an attempt to understand these differences we proposed a method
for tracking the formation of memories along the course of training, and indeed
results on memory shaping process were obtained.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HyxmF2QohQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>understanding memorization vs processing across two types of curricula in RNNs</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1z_Z2A5tX&amp;noteId=HyxmF2QohQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1185 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1185 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This manuscript attempts to use a delayed classification task to understand the dynamics of RNNs.  The hope is to use this paradigm to distinguish memorization from processing in RNNs, and to further probe when specific curricula (VoCu, DeCu) outperform each other, and what can be inferred from that.   

Quality: 
- The experimental design is sensible.  However, it is rather too much a toy example, and too narrow, hence it is unclear how much these results can be generalized across RNNs
- Highly problematic is that the key concepts in the paper -- memorization and processing -- are not well defined.  This means that the results inevitably are just interpretations rather than any sort of compelling empiricism.  After a careful read of the paper, I found it difficult to take away any particular learnings, other than "training RNNs is hard." 

Clarity:
- The paper is fairly straightforward, which is positive.
- The lack of clarity around particular definitions means that clarity is limited to the empirical results.  If the results are incredibly compelling, that would be acceptable, but absent that (as is the case here), the paper comes across to me as rather unclear in its purpose or its takeaway message.

Originality: 
- The Barak 2013 paper seems to be the key foundation for this work.  This work is sufficiently original beyond that paper.

Significance: 
- The combination of lack of clarity and limited results on a toy setting imply that the significance is rather too low.

Overall, this is a genuine effort to explore the dynamics of RNNs.  I suggest improvements can be made by either (1) working hard to clarify in the text *exactly* what question is being asked and answered, or (2) broadening the results to make a much more rigorously supported point, or (3) ideally both.

By training a 200-GRU-RNN to report the class label of a MNIST frame hidden among noisy frames, authors found different training paradigms resulted in different stability in memory structures quantified as stable fixed points. Their main finding is that training by slowly increasing the time delay between stimulus and recall creates more stable fixed point based memory for the classes.

Although the paper was clearly written in a rush, I enjoyed reading it for the most part. These are very interesting empirical findings, and I can't wait to see how well it generalizes.

# I find the title not very informative. Connection from 'Book' to 'Curriculum' is weak.

# The task does not have inherent structure that requires stable fixed points to solve. In fact, since it only requires maximum 19 time frames, it could come up with weird strategies. Since the GRU-RNN is highly flexible, there would be many solutions. The particular strategy that was learned depends on the initial network and training strategy.

# How repeatable were these findings? I do not see any error bars in Fig 2 nor table 1.

# How sensitive is this to the initial conditions? If you use the VoCu trained network as initial condition for a DeCu training, does it tighten the sloppy memory structure and make it more stable?

# I liked the Fig 2b manipulation to inject noise into the hidden states.

# English can be improved in many places.

# Algorithm 1 is not really a pseudo-code. I think it might be better to just describe it in words. This format is unnecessarily confusing and hard to understand.

# Does the backtracking fixed/slow point algorithm assume that the location of the fixed point does not change through training? Wouldn't it make more sense to investigate the pack-projection of desired output at each training step?

# PTMT, PMTP, and TaCu are not described well in the main text.

# The pharse 'basin of attraction' is losely used in a couple of places. If there isn't an attractor, its basin doesn't make sense.

# Fig 4 is not very informative. Also is this just from one network each?

# Fig 5 is too small!

# page 2: input a null label -&gt; output a null label

# it would be interesting to see how general those findings are on other tasks, e.g., n-back task with MNIST.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BkeNoZL-om" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An intriguing but preliminary investigation into RNN dynamics and generalisation</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1z_Z2A5tX&amp;noteId=BkeNoZL-om"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1185 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">15 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1185 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors investigate the hidden state dynamics of RNNs trained on a single task that mixes (but clearly separates) pattern recognition and memorisation. The authors then introduce two curricula specific to the task, and study how the trained RNNs behave under different deviations from the training protocol (generalisation). They show that under the curriculum that exhibited the best generalisation, there exist more robust (persisting for long time periods) fixed/slow points in the hidden state dynamics. They then extend the optimisation procedure developed by Sussillo &amp; Barak for continuous-time RNNs in order to find these points. Finally, they use this method to track the speed of these points during the course of training, and link spikes in speed to one of the curricula which introduces new classes over time.

Understanding RNNs - and in particular how they might "generalise" - is an important topic of research. As done previously, studying RNNs as dynamical systems is a principled way to do so. In this line of work some natural objects to look into are fixed points and even slow points (Sussillo &amp; Barak) - how long they can persist, and how large the basins of attraction are. While I believe the authors did a reasonable job following this through, I have some concerns about the experimental setup. Firstly, only one task is used - based on object classification with images - so it is unclear how generalisable these findings are, given that the authors' setup could be extended to cover at least another task, or at least another dataset. MNIST is a sanity check, and many ideas may fail to hold when extended to slightly more challenging datasets like CIFAR-10.

Secondly, as far as I can tell, the results are analysed on one network per setting, so it is hard to tell how significant the differences are. While some analyses may only make sense for single networks, e.g. Figure 3, a proper quantification of some of the results over several training runs would be appropriate.

Finally, it is worth investigating LSTMs on this task. This is not merely because they are more commonly used than GRUs, but they are strictly more powerful - see "On the Practical Computational Power of Finite Precision RNNs for Language Recognition", published at ACL 2018. Given the results in this paper and actually the paper that first introduces the forget gate for LSTMs, it seems that performing these experiments solely with GRUs might lead to wrong conclusions about RNNs in general.

There are also more minor spelling and grammatical errors throughout the text that should be addressed. For example, there is a typo on the task definition on page 2 - "the network should *output* a null label."</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
