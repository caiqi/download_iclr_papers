We extend this line of work by imposing hyperbolic geometry on the embeddings used to compute the ubiquitous attention mechanisms for different neural networks architectures. By only changing the geometry of embedding of object representations, we can use the embedding space more efficiently without increasing the number of parameters of the model. Mainly as the number of objects grows exponentially for any semantic distance from the query, hyperbolic geometry  --as opposed to Euclidean geometry-- can encode those objects without having any interference. Our method shows improvements in generalization on neural machine translation on WMT'14 (English to German), learning on graphs (both on synthetic and real-world graph tasks) and visual question answering (CLEVR) tasks while keeping the neural representations compact.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Hyperbolic Geometry, Attention Methods, Reasoning on Graphs, Relation Learning, Scale Free Graphs, Transformers, Power Law</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We propose to incorporate inductive biases and operations coming from hyperbolic geometry to improve the attention mechanism of the neural networks.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">6 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1eVP5WS6m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Reminiscent of "Lie Access Neural Turing Machines"</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxHsjRqFQ&amp;noteId=B1eVP5WS6m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">11 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper620 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Dear authors,

This is quite an interesting work, utilizing hyperbolic geometry for more efficient representation. It reminds me of a previous work "Lie Access Neural Turing Machines" that proposed to use general manifolds as the "index space" of memory items, which are attended to like in standard attention. Could you comment on the relation of your paper to that work?

Accordingly, they use Einstein midpoint to compute the aggregation weights of attention in hyperbolic space. The idea of using hyperbolic rather than Euclidean space is based on the assumption that the input embeddings (neural net activations) are on the hyperbolic manifold, which follows power-law distribution and can be seem as a smooth description of tree-like hierarchy of data points. This assumption might hold for small neural networks with relatively low dimensional output. One main reason why this paper adopts the hyperbolic space is that the volume of hyperbolic space grows exponentially with the increase of radius while that of Euclidean space grows only polynomially. Using hyperbolic distance can increase the capacity of networks and handle the complexity of data. Experiments on Transformer and relation network show that Transformer, GAT and RN with the new attention metric produce better performance than Euclidean distance.

Pros:

1. Comparing to the existing methods using representations for shallow models in hyperbolic geometry, this paper extends the idea to deep neural networks. 
2. The proposed attention mechanism can be easily applied to many of existing networks to enhance their capacity.
3. The experiments show several interesting results: 1) hyperbolic recursive transformer (RT) is consistently superior to Euclidean RT across the tasks in this paper; 2) hyperbolic space substantially benefits the low-capacity networks (i.e., low-dimensionality hidden state); 3) Einstein midpoint is better than Euclidean aggregation in hyperbolic space; 4) using sigmoid rather than softmax to compute attention weight may achieve better effectiveness on some tasks for the reason that the attention weights over different entities ay do not compete with each other.


Cons:

1. The novelty of this paper is replacing the Euclidean metric with another existing metric, which has already been used in previous ML models. So the contribution is limited.
2. As explicitly claimed in the paper and also reflected by the experimental results (e.g., Transformer-Big in Table 2). The hyperbolic metric only brings noticeable improvement to small neural nets with limited compacity on relatively small datasets. When applied it to most SOTA models (which are usually large/deep/wide neural networks) on larger datasets, it loses the advantage. This fact might seriously limit the application of the proposed technique.
3. Small models are preferred for inference especially on edge devices. But model compression and knowledge distillation can make small models having similar performance as large models, which might be much better than directly training a small model with the proposed metric.
4. Although hyperbolic metric reflects the power-law distribution, which is a very natural assumption verified on many kinds of real data (social networks and physical statistics), I am not fully convinced that it still holds on an embedding space produced by a neural net (since attention are usually applied to the outputs of a neural net). 
5. In the experiments, does the model with the proposed metric cost similar training/inference time comparing to the baselines? What is the trade-off between improvements and extra time costs? I notice that the results of the proposed attention in Table 2 are ~0.5% higher than the results from the earlier arXiv version of this paper. What is the reason for the improvements? Did you increase the training steps?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Hylg-SL927" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Refreshing approach for matching and aggregating</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxHsjRqFQ&amp;noteId=Hylg-SL927"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper620 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper620 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors propose a novel approach to improve relational-attention by changing the matching and aggregation functions to use hyperbolic geometric. By doing so the network can exploit the metric structure the functions live on.  Method was evaluated and showed improvements over baselines on wide range of tasks including translation, graph learning, and visual question answering.

Pros: 
* High quality paper. 
* Hyperbolic matching function is novel and interesting.
* Even though the subject isn’t trivial, the intuition was described well. 
* The evaluation is comprehensive on several relational related tasks. 

Cons:
* Baselines: The authors main contribution is the matching and aggregation operator. It always feels like the multi-modal community is divided between VQA and CLEVR datasets, but there should be a lot in common between them. Specifically, what is called here the matching operator, had several variants in VQA, such as Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling by Fukui et al., or Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear Pooling by You et al. etc. I think the paper would benefit from adding other variants of matching functions. 
* Datasets: I think the approach might work as well in VQA dataset, which I find more interesting than clever because of the real-world nature of it. You can plug it into methods like MFB, or as pairwise potentials in Structured Attentions by Zhu et al, or High-Order attention by Schwartz et al

Conclusion:
A better matching and aggregating operations are always important, it can potentially improve performance in many challenges. The proposed method is novel and interesting, therefore I will be happy to see this paper as part of ICLR. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_ryl7AYUH3Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>ACCEPTABLE</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxHsjRqFQ&amp;noteId=ryl7AYUH3Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper620 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">30 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper620 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">
The authors proposed to exploit hyperbolic geometry in computing the attention mechanisms for neural networks. Specifically, they break the attention read operation into two parts: matching and aggregation. In matching step, they use the hyperbolic distance to quantify the macthing between a query and a key; in the aggregation step, they use the Einstein midpoint. Their experiments results based on synthetic and real-world data shows the new method outperforms the traditional method based on Euclidean distance. This paper is acceptable.


Question: In Figure 3(Center), the number of nodes 1000 and 1200 are pretty close. How about the results on 500 nodes and 2000 nodes? It seems the accuracy difference increases as the number of nodes increases. Is this true?

Thank you for your interest in our paper.

We have provided results on VQA (CLEVR and Sort-of-CLEVR), Neural Machine Translation (WMT'14 En-De), Graph Classification Tasks (synthetic with different sizes), finally on transductive graph tasks such as Citeseer and Cora tasks in our paper. We covered a wide range of possible tasks that an attention mechanism with different architectures can be applied to. We have provided both extensive analysis and promising results on the tasks that we explored in our paper. Our goal in this paper was to show the generality of our approach on a wide range of tasks.

For the time being, we do not have any plans to provide more experiments on other datasets besides the ones that are already presented in the paper.

Best,</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
