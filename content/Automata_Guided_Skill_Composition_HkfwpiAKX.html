This work was very difficult to follow, so it is somewhat unclear what were the main contributions (since much of this seems to be covered by other works as referenced within the paper and as related to similar unreferenced works below). Moreover, regarding the experiments, many things were unclear (some of the issues are outlined below). While the overall idea of using logic in this way to help with skill composition is interesting and exciting, I believe several things must be addressed with this work. This includes: situating this work more clearly against existing similar works which use logic in this way, clearly defining the novel contributions of this work as compared to those and others, overall making the methodology more clear and specific (including experimental methodology), and comparing/contrasting against (or at least discussing differences with) methods with similar motivations (e.g., HRL multi-task learning, meta-learning) to emphasize the need/importance of this work — I am aware that at least 1 HRL work is mentioned, but this work is not really contrasted against it to help situate it.

Questions/Concerns about Experiments:

+ Does Figure 5 show the averaged return over 5 runs, sum of discounted rewards averaged over 5 episodes per update step, or 5 episodes, each from a separate run averaged together? It is a bit unclear especially because the main text and the figure caption slightly differ. Also, average discounted return is somewhat different than average return,  suggest updating the label to be clear also with the discount factor used.
+ What were the standard deviations for this across experiments? Even with averaging it seems that these runs are very high variance, would be good to understand what variance bounds to expect if using this method.
+ Why were average discounted returns reported in Figure 5 and not in Table 1?
+  What were the standard deviations on success rate and training time? Also what about sample complexity? 
+ To my understanding the benefit here is reusability of learned skills via the automata methods described here. It would have made sense to compare against other HRL or multi-task learning methods in addition to just SQL or learning from scratch. For example how would MAML compare to this?
+ It is also unclear whether the presented results in Table 1 and Figure 5 are on the real robot or in simulation. The main text says, “All of our training is performed in simulation and the policy is able to transfer to the real robot without further fine-tuning.” So does this mean that Figure 5 is simulated results and Table 1 is on the real robot?

This method provides a structured solution for reusing learned skills (with scTLTL formulas), and can also help when new skills need to be involved in original tasks. The topic of the composition of skills is interesting. However, the joining of LTL and RL has been developed previously. The main contribution of this work is limited to the application of the previous techniques.

The proposed approach also has some limitations. 
Will this method work on composing scTLTL formula with temporal operators other than disjunction and conjunction?
Can this approach deal with continuous state space and actions? This paper describes a discretization way, which, however, can introduce inaccuracies. 
The design of the skills is by hand, which restricts badly its usability.
The experiments results show that the composition method does better than soft Q-learning on composing learned policies, but how it performed compared to earlier hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithms?

This idea is motivated by the desirability of compositional policies. I find the idea compelling, but I am not sure the proposed method is a useful solution. Overall, the description of the method is difficult to follow. With more explanations (perhaps an algorithm box?), I would consider increasing my score.

The experiments demonstrate that this method can outperform SQL at skill composition. However, it is unclear how much prior knowledge is used to define the automaton. If prior knowledge is used to construct the FSA, then a missing comparison would be to first find the optimal path through the FSA and then optimize a controller to accomplish it. As the paper is not very clear, that might be the method in the paper. 

Questions:
- How do you obtain the number of automaton states? 
- In Figure 1, are the state transitions learned or handcoded? Are they part of the policy's action space?
- In section 3.2, you state  s_{t:t+k} |= f(s)&lt;c ⇔ f(s_t)&lt;c    What does s without a timestep subscript refer to? Why does this statement hold?

Can you specify more clearly what you assume known in the experiments? What is learned in the automata? In Figure 5, does SQL have access to the same information as Automata Guided Composition?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
