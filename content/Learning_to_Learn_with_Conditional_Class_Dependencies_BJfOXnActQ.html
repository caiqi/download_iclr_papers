Although some label structure can implicitly be obtained when training on huge amounts of data, in a few-shot learning context where little data is available, making explicit use of the label structure can inform the model to reshape the representation space to reflect a global sense of class dependencies.  We propose a meta-learning framework, Conditional class-Aware Meta-Learning (CAML), that conditionally transforms feature representations based on a metric space that is trained to capture inter-class dependencies. This enables a conditional modulation of the feature representations of the base-learner to impose regularities informed by the label space.

The paper presents an enhancement to the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework to integrate class dependency into the gradient-based meta-learning procedure. Specifically, the class dependency is encoded by embedding the training examples via a clustering network into a metric space where semantic similarity is preserved via affinity under Euclidean distance. Embedding of an example in this space is further employed to modulate (scale and shift) features of the example extracted by the base-learner via a transformation network, and the final prediction is made on top of the modulated features. Experiments on min-ImageNet shows that the proposed approach improves the baseline of MAML.    

Pros
- An interesting idea of leveraging class dependency in meta-learning.
- Solid implementation with reasonable technical solutions.

Cons
- Some relevant interesting areas/cases were not exploited/tested.
- Improvement over state-of-the-arts (SOA) is marginal or none. 

[Originality]
The paper is motivated by an interesting observation that class dependency in the label space can also provide insights for meta-learning. This seems to be first introduced in the context of  meta-learning.

[Quality]
Overall the paper is well executed in some aspects, including motivation and technical implementation. There are, however, a few areas/cases I would like to see more from it so as to make a stronger case. 

In terms of generalization, the proposed enhancement to MAML is claimed to be orthogonal to other SOAs that are also within the framework based on gradient-descent, e.g. LEO. It is not quite clear to me that if the use of class dependency can lead to general benefits to alike methods like LEO, or if it is just a specific case for the MAML baseline. Actually, it would be interesting to see how the proposed class-conditional modulation can help other SOA in table 1. Also, more empirical results from other use cases (e.g., other datasets or problems) also help provide more insights here. These augmentation can better justify the value or significance of this work.       

In the specific formulation of the approach in Fig 2, it looks to me that the whole system is a compounded framework that combines two classifiers with one (base-learner) producing base representation, and the second injects side-information (e.g., from class-dependency in this case) to modulates the base representation before the final prediction. I just wonder what would happen if similar process keeps on? E.g., by building the third stage that modulates the features from the previous two? Or what if we swap the roles of base-learner and the embedding from the metric space (i.e., using the base-learner to modulate the embedding)? It looks to me that the feature/embedding from both components (in Fig 5 and 6) are optimized to improve separability. The roles they play in this process are also very interesting to get more elucidation. 
 
Another point worth discussion is that the class dependency currently imposed does not see to include hierarchical structure among classes, i.e., the label space is still flat. It would be great if this can be briefly discussed with respect to the current formulation to better inspire the future work.

[Clarity]
The paper is generally well written and I did not have much difficulty to follow. 

[Significance]
While the paper is built on an interesting idea, there are still a few areas for further improvement to justify its significance (the the comments above).

Significant contribution to meta-learning by incorporating latent metrics on labels.

* Summary

The manuscript builds on the observation that using structured information from the labels space improves learning accuracy. The proposed method --CAML-- is an instance of MAML (Finn et al., 2017), where an additional embedding is used to characterize the dissimilarity among labels.

While quite natural, the proposed method is supported by a clever metric learning step. The classes are first represented by centroids and an optimal mapping $\phi$ is then learnt by maximizing a clustering entropy (similarly to what is performed in a K-means-flavored algorithm, though this connection is not made in the manuscript). A conditional batch normalization (Dumoulin et al., 2017) is then used to model how closeness (in the embedding space $f_\phi$) among labels is taken into account at the meta-learning level.

Existing literature is well acknowledged and I find the numerical experiments to be convincing. In my opinion, a clear accept.

* Minor issues

- I would suggest adding a footnote explaining why Table 1 reports confidence intervals and not just standard deviations. How are constructed those intervals?
- Section 3.2 bears ambiguity as the manuscript reads "We first define centroids [...]" depending on $f_\phi$ which is then defined as the argument of the minim of the entropy term. What appears as a circular definition is merely the effect of loose writing yet I am afraid it would confuse readers. I would suggest to rewrite this part, maybe using a pseudo-code to better make the point that $f_\phi$ is learnt.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1lyuO0foX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A paper with clear idea for few-shot learning, but there are still some questions about the paper. </a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJfOXnActQ&amp;noteId=H1lyuO0foX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1374 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">16 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1374 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes a new few-shot learning method with class dependencies. To consider the structure in the label space, the authors propose to use conditional batch normalization to help change the embedding based on class-wise statistics. Based on which the final classifier can be learned by the gradient-based meta-learning method, i.e., MAML. Experiments on MiniImageNet show the proposed method can achieve high-performance, and the proposed part can be proved to be effective based on the ablation study.

There are three main concerns about this paper, and the final rating depends on the authors' response.
1. The motivation
The authors claim the label structure is helpful in the few-shot learning. If the reviewer understands correctly, it is the change of embedding network based on class statistics that consider such a label structure. From the objective perspective, there are no terms related to this purpose, and the embedding space learning is also based on the same few-shot objective. Will it introduces more information w.r.t. only using embedding space to do the classification?

2. The novelty.
This paper looks like a MAML version of TADAM. Both of the methods use the conditional batch normalization in the embedding network, while CAML uses MAML to learn another classifier based on the embedding. Although CAML uses the CBN at the example level and considers the class information in a transductive setting, it is not very novel. From the results, the proposed method uses a stronger network but does not improve a lot w.r.t. TADAM.

3. Method details
3.1 Since CBN is example induced, will it prone to overfitting?
3.2 About the model architecture. 
CAML uses a 4*4 skip connection from input to output. It is OK to use this improve the final performance, but the authors also need to show the results without the skip connection to fairly compare with other methods. Is this skip connection very important for this particular model? Most methods use 64 channel in the convNet while 30 channels are used in this paper. Is this computational consideration or to avoid overfitting? It is a bit strange that the main network is just four layers but the conditional network is a larger and stronger resNet.
3.3 About the MAML gradients
How to compute the gradient in the MAML flow? Will the embedding network be updated simultaneously? In other words, will the MAML objective influences the embedding network?
3.4 The training details are not clear. 
The concrete training setting is not clear. For example, does the method need model pre-train? What is the learning rate, and how to adapt it? For the MAML, we also need the inner-update learning rate. How many epochs does CAML need?
3.5 How about build MAML directly on the embedding space?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
