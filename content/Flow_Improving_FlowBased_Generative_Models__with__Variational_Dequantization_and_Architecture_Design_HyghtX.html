Despite their computational efficiency, flow-based models generally have much worse density modeling performance compared to state-of-the-art autoregressive models. In this paper, we carefully investigate three design choices employed by prior flow-based models that turn out to be limiting: (1) uniform noise is a sub-optimal dequantization choice that hurts both training loss and generalization; (2) commonly used affine coupling flows are not expressive enough; (3) conv-net based parametrization of flows fails to capture the global image context. Based on our findings, we propose Flow++, a set of alternative design choices that significantly improve the density modeling capacity of flow-based models. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Deep Generative Models, Normalizing Flows, RealNVP, Density Estimation</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Improved training of current flow-based generative models (Glow and RealNVP) on density estimation benchmarks</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1e0_khKhX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Three threads of improvements to normalizing flow models, reducing the gap between AR and non-AR models</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyg74h05tX&amp;noteId=S1e0_khKhX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1435 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1435 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Improvements are attained on two image datasets by (a) variational dequantization, (b) mixture CDF coupling layers, and (c) self-attention in conditioning net.

Quality: The work is fine, demonstrating familiarity with recent work in flows and improving upon it. The experiments are on CIFAR-10 and 32x32 ImageNet. Unclear if the evaluation numbers are on a test set or a 'validation' set. I will be assuming test set. The visualizations are fine, but not nearly as convincing as the Glow visualizations on CelebA.

Clarity: The presentation is clear enough, and the motivation seems reasonable, though the assertion that all AR models are slow seems a bit belied by the recent WaveRNN work, which gets a Wavenet like model running in realtime on a phone. On the other hand, I felt like the proposed fixes were all a bit scattered here &amp; there. Each could stand as a research topic on its own, and one paper can't fit in much analysis of all three. For example, a RealNVP style model usually needs to shuffle or reverse the channels to attain decent performance, but there's no discussion of how/whether that is done here. Folks wanting to replicate this work would want a formula for the tractable log-abs-det-jacobian of the coupling layer, but all we have is "involves calculating the pdf of the logistic mixtures".

Originality: Self-attention is not new, though its uptake in the conditioning networks of flow models has been slow/nonexistent. I found the dequantization improvement more novel. The new proposal for a coupling layer seems like a clever way of introducing more parameters in a structured manner. 

Significance: Bringing flow models closer to the performance of AR models is good progress.


Questions
I wonder whether some kind of spline or cubic interpolation might achieve similar improvement over the uniform dequantization. Perhaps uniform is not the best baseline?
The new coupling layer might just be viewed as a way of introducing many more parameters in a structured manner. Have you compared parameter counts?
Appendix B shows some portion of the code, but seems like a missed opportunity to fit this into a framework like tfp.bijectors. The code seems glued in somewhat slapdash. For example, the tf_go function looks like debugging/logging code (unwanted), and lacks any usage.

I think this work is promising and interesting to the probabilistic modeling community, but needs some cleanup and some more compelling presentation (non image data? Glow-style graphics?).</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SkxrmDQunQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Three ingredients for more powerful flow-based model</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyg74h05tX&amp;noteId=SkxrmDQunQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1435 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1435 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper offers architectural improvements for flow-based models that enable them to be very competitive with autoregressive models in terms of bits/dim metrics while still providing efficient sampling scheme. The three main contributions are the use of variational dequantization scheme, more powerful element-wise bijections (mixture of logistic CDF), and multi-head self-attention in the dependency structure. 
The two first contributions are in my opinion the most interesting as:
- variational dequantization demonstrates the improvement that one can obtain by redefining part of the image processing that has been overlooked before;
- the inversion of element-wise bijection without closed form inverse can be efficiently approximated with bisection (binary search).
The performances achieved by the resulting model are in my opinion a stepping stone in the area of flow-based models and encouraging as to their potential. 
The ablation study suggest that each contribution by themselves only improve slightly the model but that their simultaneous application results in a stronger boost in performance, which I can't explain from the paper. Nonetheless, some this ablation study was useful in tearing apart the contribution of each of several pieces of the model (missing pieces being gated convolutions, dropout, and instance normalization), although without explaining them.
Although flow-based model can intuitively sample faster than autoregressive models, the measure of sampling time is a bit interesting as an actual evidence of that claim. But the analysis of sampling time should be done on same hardware as to fair comparison before it can be a convincing argument. 
Concerning variational dequantization, is there a reason coupling layer architecture was used instead of potentially more powerful model with less convenient inverses such as inverse autoregressive flow?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SylTRPCaom" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>interesting improvements for RealNVP/Glow models, but not well analysed</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyg74h05tX&amp;noteId=SylTRPCaom"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1435 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">24 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1435 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper improves upon the Real NVP/Glow design by proposing better dequantization schemes and more expressive forms of coupling layers. I really like Real NVP models, which I think are a bit underappreciated. Thus, Iâ€™m happy that there are papers trying to improve their performance.  However, I wish this was done with more rigour.

The paper makes 3 claims about the current flow models: (1) it is suboptimal to use additive uniform noise when dequantizing images, (2) affine coupling layers are not expressive enough, and (3) the architectures fail to capture global image context. Iâ€™ll comment on these claims and proposed solutions below.

(1) I agree with the reasoning behind the need for a better dequantization distribution. However, I think the authors should provide an evidence that the lower bound is indeed loose when q is uniform. For example, for the CIFAR-10 model, the authors calculated a gap of 0.025 bpd when using variational dequantization. What would this gap be when using uniform q?  Maybe, a clear illustration of the dequantization effect on a simpler dataset or a toy example would be more useful.

(2) My main concern about the mixture CDFs coupling layer is how much bigger the model becomes and how much slower it trains. I find this analysis crucial when deciding whether 0.05 bpd improvement as reported in Table 1 is worth the hassle.

(3) As a person not familiar with the Transformer, I couldnâ€™t understand how exactly self-attention works and how much it helps the model to capture the global image context. Also, I think this problem needs a separate illustration on a dataset of larger images.  
  
The experiments section is very weak in backing up the identified problems and proposed solutions. Firstly, I think it is more clear if the ablation study is done in reverse: instead of making Flow++ and removing components, start with the vanilla model and then add stuff.  Secondly, itâ€™s not clear if these improvements generalize across datasets, e.g. when images are larger than 32x32. Though, larger inputs may lead to huge models which are impossible to train when the resources are quite limited. Thatâ€™s why I find it important to report how much complexity is added compared to the initial Real NVP. Also, I think itâ€™s a well-known fact that sampling from PixelCNN models is slow unlike for Real NVPs, so I donâ€™t find the results in Table 3 surprising or even useful. 

To conclude, I find this paper unfinished and wouldnâ€™t recommend its acceptance until the analysis of the problems and their solutions becomes better thought out.  </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
