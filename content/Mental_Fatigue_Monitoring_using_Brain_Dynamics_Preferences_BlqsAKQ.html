Previous studies leverage the response time (RT) as the metric for mental fatigue and aim at estimating the exact value of RT using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals within a regression model. However, due to the easily corrupted EEG signals and also non-smooth RTs during data collection, regular regression methods generally suffer from poor generalization performance.  Considering that human response time is the reflection of brain dynamics preference rather than a single value, a novel model called Brain Dynamic ranking (BDrank) has been proposed. BDrank could learn from brain dynamics preferences using EEG data robustly and preserve the ordering corresponding to RTs. BDrank model is based on the regularized alternative ordinal classification comparing to regular regression based practices. Furthermore, a transition matrix is introduced to characterize the reliability of each channel used in EEG data, which helps in learning brain dynamics preferences only from informative EEG channels. In order to handle large-scale EEG signals~and obtain higher generalization, an online-generalized Expectation Maximum (OnlineGEM) algorithm also has been proposed to update BDrank in an online fashion. Comprehensive empirical analysis on EEG signals from 44 participants shows that BDrank together with OnlineGEM achieves substantial improvements in reliability while simultaneously detecting possible less informative and noisy EEG channels.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">mental fatigue, brain dynamics preference, brain dynamics ranking, channel reliability, channel Selection</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">5 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rklvQRB1TX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Review of mental fatigue monitoring using brain dynamics preferences</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1l9qsA5KQ&amp;noteId=rklvQRB1TX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper559 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">07 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper559 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The mental fatigue is an important factor in road accidents. Finding a direct mapping between EEG features and reaction time is difficult and error-prone, combining the noise measurement of EEG and individual variation of RT.  The authors introduce a measure called BDrank based on partial ordering instead of regression. Formulating the measure as a MAP problem, the authors propose a generalized EM algorithm for prediction. An online extension, relying on iterative L-BFGS optimization over mini-batches. 

Figure 3 shows the indegree sequence for 4 selected subjects. What is the criterion to select these subjects? These cases seem interesting, but is it representative for the best/worst case? It could provide some information to show some of the few cases where SVR is more accurate than BDrank.
Regarding the identification of noisy channels, the 33rd channel is indicated as a non-EEG one. What is it?

Some minor questions and suggestions:
- It could be interesting to mention the performance of this measure using only a limited set of EEG channels to evaluate its robustness.
- The introduction indicates that de Naurois et al ., 2017 rely on EEG to estimate the RT, but it is not the case.
- The formulation of the assumption (2) on page 3 is unclear, as sensors are not supposed to make any emission and there is a high correlation between channels.
- The model do not consider transition between type-1 and -2 preference, could it be a problem with confidence interval</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1eeawVR37" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Work seems interesting but has limited theoretical advancement; appears to be out of scope for ICLR</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1l9qsA5KQ&amp;noteId=H1eeawVR37"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper559 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper559 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper proposes an algorithm for mental fatigue monitoring, relating a subjects' EEG signals to their reaction time (RT) during a simulated driving task, as an ordinal regression problem. The authors argue that RTs could be heavily skewed and/or non-smooth, making traditional regression approaches unstable due to outlier values. They propose a brain dynamic ranking algorithm,  BDrank, using a generalized EM algorithm to estimate its parameters, and compare it to support vector regression and Logistic Ordinal Regression, where they show improved performance by accuracy and root mean squared error (RMSE) over a database of 44 subjects.

General comments, in no particular order:

1. There are some minor grammatical errors throughout. The paper could benefit from another read-through to correct these errors.

2. It is unclear to me how the model works at test time; as the model is essentially building a relational structure in the data, does the user have to provide multiple EEG trials at time of prediction?

3. There is notation early on in the paper that doesn't appear to be appropriately defined. For example, Equation (1) describes two sets of propositions, with M1 and M2 elements, respectively. How is M1 and M2, the total set of propositions, calculated? It appears to be all pair-wise comparisons of RTs but then it's unclear why there are two indexes associated with them. Also, what does it mean for the orderings to be significant? (i.e.: that the "type-1 preference propositions that the orderings between the RTs are significant"). The authors then switch to a new notation x^1 and x^2 without defining them. Notational problems also persist throughout the paper, making it hard to gauge what is being done at each step.

4. The authors describe using an FFT to transform the EEG data into the frequency domain. I'm assuming they are doing the FFT on the entire 10-s interval but the paper does not make this clear. Also, the authors state using EEG power between 0-30Hz for their analysis; do they further sub-divide this range (for example, to the standard theta/alpha/beta power ranges) or just use the power across the entire 0-30Hz band?

5. I am concerned with the relatively sparse set of comparison algorithms the authors use. The authors only compare to relatively simple approaches (support vector regression and logistic ordinal regression), yet they cite many previous works in this area but do not compare against them, instead just leaving a pretty generic statement of "The regression assumption of this method between EEG signals and RT is not correct"; they do not elaborate on this aspect.

 
Overall I think there is limited novelty in the approach; the idea to learn the structure of the data relationally instead of absolutely is pretty straight-forward, and is a standard practice for example in non-parametric statistical modeling. I am also not positive that ICLR is the best venue for this work; perhaps a better avenue for this would be in a more BCI/neural engineering-focused venue.

The paper is written in a rather confusing manner, which makes the assessment of originality and significance a hard task for the reviewer. A novel algorithm Bdrank (based on raking is defined) and compared to 2 other algorithms; unclear why with these and not with others. The paper ignores a large portion of the literature, starting with Kohlmorgen et al 2007, Blankertz group, Lee group etc.

We summarize your comments into the following three sub-problems and answer each one separately.

Q1: It is unclear why the paper compares with two algorithms (SVR and LOR) and not with others. 
A1: Considering the non-smooth property of human response time during data collection, regular regression methods generally suffer from poor generalization performance.   In this paper, we introduce BDrank, which could learn from brain dynamics preferences. Particularly, BDrank aims at preserving the ordering corresponding to the whole RTs instead of estimating the exact value of a single RT like previous attempts. Therefore, the main argument of this paper lies in Regression V.S. Ordinal Classification. 
SVR is chosen as the representative for the regression-based attempts for the following concerns: (1) SVR is considered to achieve the same performance with the shallow neural networks, while the parameters for SVR are much easier to tune to the best using cross-validation, as we did in the paper. (2) The number of trials for each participant is about 200, which is too small to train a deep neural network. (3) As is shown in Figure 3, even the SVR (using 5-fold cross validation) is still easier to overfit due to the non-smooth property of RTs, let alone other neural network based attempts. 
LOR is chosen as the representative for the ordinal classification based attempts due to its simplicity. LOR is optimized with L-BFGS with the default setting for all participants. The surprising result of LOR is a strong support to our claim that ordinal classification based attempts are more suitable for mental fatigue evaluation.  Of course, LOR can be easily replaced with more complex structures, e.g. neural network, to achieve more superior performance. Furthermore, LOR can also be extended to input image data, like fMRI. 
In a word, SVR and LOR are selected with careful consideration. The two baselines are considered to be a strong support for our claims: (1) Ordinal Classification based attempts are more suitable for mental fatigue evaluation, especially with non-smooth response variable (RTs); (2) the channel state indeed affects the performance of the learning model. Note that our BDrank, introducing a transition matrix on top of LOR, still enjoys the superiority for LOR.  Those extensions, which are not the focus of this paper, are left for later studies.

Q2: The results are only somewhat interesting, no understanding of the underlying physiological processes is given. 
Page 2, Experiment Paradigm section mentioned that data recorded from the previous study from Huang et al 2015, showed that EEG related activity is correlated with behavioural information like reaction time (RT) and demonstrated that how the decline in vigilance occur during driving. The results presented in this paper further demonstrated that indeed behavioural information like RT is highly related to EEG brain dynamics.
Further, Table 1 adopts the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic to verify whether the learning model could maintain the pairwise comparison between two EEG signals (See Figure 1B). In terms of LOR and our BDrank, we just collect the prediction accuracy for each pairwise comparison and average on the whole dataset. In terms of SVR, we followed the standard procedure to train the learning model for each participant and then get the predicted RTs on the training and test dataset, respectively. Instead of calculating the RMSE loss, we calculate the classification error on the generated pairwise comparisons as what we do for LOR and BDrank.
Table 2 and Figure 3 adopt the indegree sequence to verify whether the learning model could preserving the global ordering corresponding to RTs.  We first collected the indegree sequences (See Appendix) of the constructed directed graph using the predicted RTs and then measured the indegree discrepancy between the calculated indegree sequences and the ground truth using the root-mean-squared error (RMSE). See Figure 3, if the predicted indegree sequences could closely align with the ground truth, the learning model can perfectly preserve the whole ordering w.r.t. RTs.
Figure 4 presents the estimated state of different channels for forty-four participants. Each column denotes the states of 33 channels for each participant. According to our analysis, the parameter \pi_n in the transition matrix indicates the channel reliability. Then we classify the 33 channels into positive (\pi_n&gt;0.85), noisy (0.15&lt;\pi_n&lt;0.85) and negative (\pi_n&lt;0.15) channels according to the estimated channel reliability \pi_n. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJgLHEsPa7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Our work is fundamental but not preliminary.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1l9qsA5KQ&amp;noteId=BJgLHEsPa7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper559 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">13 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper559 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Q3: I consider the paper somewhat preliminary.
We do not agree with this statement. This work is fundamental but not preliminary. In this work, we proposed two claims: (1) learning from brain dynamic preferences; (2) channel state-aware within the learning model. And we resort to enough experiments to support our claims. In particular, in Table 1 and Table 2, LOR without fine-tuning achieves competitive performance with SVR, while the parameter of SVR is learned with 5-ford cross-validation. BDrank achieves better performance over LOR benefiting from the introduced transition matrix, which enables BDrank to only learn from reliable channels.  
Our BDank is a basic model, which can be further extended to containing more complex structures when dealt with difficult situations, which are considered not the focus in this work.  </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
