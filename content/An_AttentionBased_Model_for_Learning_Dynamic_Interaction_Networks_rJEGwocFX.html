Spatio-temporal graphs have been proved to be a useful tool to abstract interaction graphs and previous works exploits carefully designed feed-forward architecture to preserve such structure. We argue to scale such network design to real-world problem, a model needs to automatically learn a meaningful representation of the possible relations. Learning such interaction structure is not trivial: on the one hand, a model has to discover the hidden relations between different problem factors in an unsupervised way; on the other hand, the mined relations have to be interpretable. 

In this paper, we propose an attention module able to project a graph sub-structure in a fixed size embedding, preserving the influence that the neighbours exert on a given vertex. On a comprehensive evaluation done on real-world as well as toy task, we found our model competitive against strong baselines.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">dynamic networks, interaction graphs, attention model</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">A graph neural network able to automatically learn and leverage a dynamic interactive graph structure</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJgqQsVQaX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>The paper is not prepared for acceptance</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEGwo0cFX&amp;noteId=BJgqQsVQaX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper246 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">10 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper246 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper aims to learn interactions between agents based on an attention-based model. I admit that the paper is interesting and well motivated, but it is still far from being publishable. The reasons are the following:

First, the authors claim that DIAN is an attention-based mechanism spanning over both time and graph structure, and also based on different edge representation than Hohsen (2017) and Velickovic (2017). Some of the differences are mentioned in the introduction, but why such differences are necessary or are increasing the merit of the problem in general?

Second, the paper claims it is different than Kipf (2018) which considers independent edge interactions. Instead, they consider global views. Such statements are particularly vague.  

Third, what is the objective function in their learning mechanism? Did I somehow miss that? Could the authors refer to where they are pointed out?

Fourth, despite there are papers which consider attention over graph structure, I am a bit skeptical because for graphs we have short diameters and then why we really need attention in such case?

Apart from these, the presentation of the paper is too poor.  The abstract contains, "we argue to scale such network design..." . Somehow, that is a bit misleading. If I understand correctly, the entire model lies over an underlying network, not network processing.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SkexTafA2X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An application paper below the acceptance bar</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEGwo0cFX&amp;noteId=SkexTafA2X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper246 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper246 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes to apply attention mechanism to process message passing in a graph over time. It suffers from the following limitations:

- The problem definition is unclear. What is the objective of the proposed model? Predict the attributes of a specific node or all the nodes? Forecast the types or weights of edges? Dynamically change the graph architecture? It is vague in the elaboration. The authors should prove precise and concise mathematical definitions of the task.

- The background discussion is inadequate. As the proposed method is a follow-up research of GNN, the authors should present more discussions on previous GNN, GCN, and message passing designs.

- The technique contribution is limited.  In my opinion, the proposed framework is a straightforward simplification of a general GNN design. The authors highlight their contributions on sub-graph (neighbors) operation over time. Nevertheless, this is nature consideration or built-in design in a GNN with message passing mechanism.

- The proposed applying attention mechanism in graph operation is nothing new without a comprehensive design. For instance, does the proposed method can be scaled up for a high-degree graph? There is no discussion or analysis but only empirical descriptions. 

- What does it by claiming "DIAN do not have a different network for each edge type, but only different encoders for a given node and its neighbors." If "edge type" means different modalities or embeddings of different dimensions, the proposed method can not handle different edge type by simply using an RNN encoder either. 

- Equation (1) should be removed or it is necessary to explain what Q and K represent.

- Typos. "... the a given node..." and etc.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: Clear rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1xNDqR8oX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Original problem and method but lacks solid experimental results.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJEGwo0cFX&amp;noteId=H1xNDqR8oX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper246 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">19 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper246 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This work proposes an attention-based method for the stated task of dynamic network discovery. Please find below some of the pros and cons of the paper.

Pros:

1. The authors investigate a method which can handle data with temporal and spatial dependencies which is an important problem. 

2. Showed experiments on several synthetic datasets as well as multiple real-world datasets.

Cons:

1. The paper in its current form isn't very polished yet and clarity can still be improved in several ways:
   * There were more than a few spelling and grammatical errors, please proofread the work and improve the writing. For example, some spelling errors are: Tab. 1 "Sequence lenght," last sentence pg. 10 "whit respect," and in the discussion prior to Eq. 5 "average polling."
   * The paper's stated goal seems to be studying the problem of identifying the latent interaction graph of a system. However, after reading the introduction and looking at the example in Fig. 1 I don't really get the sense as to why this is important. Is it for anomaly detection? Or for urban planning (assuming we are studying traffic flow? If yes, how? The approach needs to be motivated better.

2. From reading the abstract and the introduction, it seems to me that the main problem that is studied is that of identifying the latent dynamic networks from spatio-temporal data. However, most of the experiments in my opinion don't help in showing why the proposed method is useful for such task.
   * The network discovery problem is a well-studied problem. In one application area which is that of functional brain network analysis [1,2], the task is to discover the latent functional network (in this case just a single network). In these studies they usually test whether the approach can retrieve the well-known ground-truth default mode functional network and also synthetically generated latent networks (with known correlations/weights). Apart from a few rather limited experiments in the appendix, the authors don't seem to do experiments on network discovery and they certainly don't do any analysis to retrieve ground-truth networks.
   * For instance, can the retrieved dynamic networks be useful for anomaly detection? 
   * Also, why do the authors make the assumption that the neighbors of a node are fixed. If we are looking at just traffic networks we may assume that a node is only connected to other spatially close nodes but won't it be interesting also to model indirect influence (maybe an accident in a node further away affecting flow later on).
   
3. The authors test the performance of the proposed model on the forecasting task on 3 real-world datasets. If the goal of this experiment is to show the usefulness of modeling spatio-temporal dependencies using their approach for forecasting, then the authors should at least evaluate against a stronger set of baselines. They test against several methods but most don't seem to be designed for this. For instance a quick search of related literature brings up the following related deep methods for traffic flow forecasting (setting might vary a little) which considers both spatial and temporal information [3,4]. 
   * Also, please show the SD in Table 3.
   * Are you aware of [5] which studies a warp-invariant RNN?

The problem which the authors study and the proposed method are both quite novel. However, the paper clarity can be improved. Also, the experimental results are not enough to back up the paper's main claims.
