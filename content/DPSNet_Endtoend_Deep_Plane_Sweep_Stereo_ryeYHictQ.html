Recent methods address this problem through deep learning, which can utilize semantic cues to deal with challenges such as textureless and reflective regions. In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network called DPSNet (Deep Plane Sweep Network) whose design is inspired by best practices of traditional geometry-based approaches. Rather than directly estimating depth and/or optical flow correspondence from image pairs as done in many previous deep learning methods, DPSNet takes a plane sweep approach that involves building a cost volume from deep features using the plane sweep algorithm, regularizing the cost volume via a context-aware cost aggregation, and regressing the depth map from the cost volume. The cost volume is constructed using a differentiable warping process that allows for end-to-end training of the network. Through the effective incorporation of conventional multiview stereo concepts within a deep learning framework, DPSNet achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction results on a variety of challenging datasets.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Deep Learning, Stereo, Depth, Geometry</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">A convolution neural network for multi-view stereo matching whose design is inspired by best practices of traditional geometry-based approaches</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">5 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJeI9Oz5hQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Likely Accept: but requires some comments to be addressed</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryeYHi0ctQ&amp;noteId=rJeI9Oz5hQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper108 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper108 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper describes a method for learning a deep neural network for multi-view stereo. The overall network includes feature-extraction layers applied to all images, followed by a spatial-transformer network (which is differentiable, but with no learnable parameters) that is applied to warp these features from every matching image to the reference image's co-ordinate frame for a series of candidate depth planes, followed by concatenation of the reference and match image features and 3D convolution layers to form a cost volume. The cost volumes of different pairs are averaged, and additional layers are used to refine this cost volume while relying on the reference image's RGB features, followed by soft-max and an expectation over depth values to output the final depth at each pixel. The entire network is trained end-to-end and experiments show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods for MVS by a significant margin on a number of datasets.

Overall, I have a positive view of the paper and believe it should be accepted to ICLR. However, I would like the authors to address the following issues:

- While the proposed network is complex, I do believe the description of the architecture could be a little better. It would be good to clarify that i indexes view (and N is the total number of views), and provide a few more definitions for the terms in equation (2): namely, are R and t the extrinsics of the reference camera or the i^th camera, etc. The overall approach is clear (for each plane, the method maps features from the paired camera to the reference camera  assuming all points in the the world lie on that plane), but it would be good to clarify the specifics. It might also be useful to emphasize that the cost-volume generation is per-pair (perhaps change the title of Sec 3.2) and that these volumes are averaged for all pairs.

- It might also be useful to apply the algorithm to the rectified binocular stereo case (where the warping and definition of planes by disparity are much simpler), and show comparisons to the many stereo algorithms on datasets like KITTI. At some level, the proposed algorithm can be thought of taking approaches proved to be successful for rectified binocular stereo and generalizing them (by generic warping + plane sweep) to the multi-view case. Hence, such comparisons could be illuminating. (Note: the method doesn't need to outperform the state-of-the-art there, but the results would be informative).

- I do believe the paper would significantly benefit from more discussion of DeepMVS since it's clearly the closest to this method (also solves MVS by deep networks + plane sweep). DeepMVS also learns the matching cost for cost volume generation, and the major difference seems to be that this method is learned end-to-end. It would be better to have a more detailed discussion of the differences (the current discussion at the end of Sec 2 is a little short on details)---architectures, super-vision at the end of the cost-volume vs end-to-end, etc.

This paper proposes an end-to-end learnable  multiview stereo depth estimation network, which is basically very similar to the GCNet (Kendall et.al 2017) or PSMNet (Chang et.al 2018) for stereo estimation. The differences are using SPN to warp feature w.r.t RT, adding a multi view averaging cost and a cost aggregation component for final depth regression, which transform the original network to support multi-view stereo, yielding performance boost over other baselines.

Technically, I believe it is sound  because cost volume from stereo matching has already been demonstrate very effective in boosting performance because it use underlining geometry constraint.  My major concern lies in three aspects. 

1) Another most recent SOTA algorithm is  MVSNet (Yao et.al ECCV 2018), the paper should be considered for comparison. In addition, the structure is even more similar with the proposed network architecture.  

2) The evaluation metrics are mostly use for single view depths, it is not consistent with paper of DeepMVS (Tab. 1) or that from MVSNet. Therefore, it might be hard to actual understand whether the numbers are  exactly comparable. 

3) Since the method largely improved over their baseline algorithms, and the number between different papers are hard to compare. In my opinion, to better show the results,  I suggest submitting results to an online benchmark with test data for verifying the results. such as ETH3D multi view benchmark, where everything is standardized. 

I hope the author can make strong feedback for validating the results.

Like some previous methods, a 'cost volume' is first computed by plane sweeping, in other words the cost volume is indexed by the 2D locations in the image plane, and the disparities for 3D planes parallel to the image plane. A network then predicts the disparities for each image location from this cost volume.

The contributions with respect to the state-of-the-art are:

- the cost volume is computed using differential warps, thus the network can be trained end-to-end;

- a better cost volume is computed from the original cost volume and the reference image.

The results look good, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The paper reads well, and related work is correctly referenced.

There is nothing wrong with the proposed method, it makes sense and I am convinced it works well. However, I found the contributions quite straightforward, and it is difficult to get excited about the paper.

More details would be welcome for Section 3.2</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HygmvWIH5Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Access to Code</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryeYHi0ctQ&amp;noteId=HygmvWIH5Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper108 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thanks to the author(s) for this contribution! Are you planning on releasing the PyTorch code for DPSNet?

Also, a implementation question regarding warping the target and reference images to a virtual plane.  At the end of page 3 you describe the formulation for the transformation with respect to the intrinsics, extrinsics, and the particular depth of the virtual plane. You continue to say you use the spatial transform network (STN) to implement this warping. STN defines it transformations with respect to a 2x2 rotation R and 2x1 translation T. What are the values of R and T w.r.t. the intrinsics, extrinsics, and depth?

Thank you again!</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJgWT3KSq7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Re: Access to Code</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryeYHi0ctQ&amp;noteId=BJgWT3KSq7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper108 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper108 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Hello, thank you for your feedback and your interest in our work. Regarding your comments:


1. We will release our PyTorch implementation for DPSNet upon the acceptance of this paper.

2. The camera rotation R (3x3 matrix) and transform T (3x1 vector) described in our paper are defined in 3D space. Camera extrinsic [R | T] and the intrinsic parameter K are used to obtain the projected image coordinates (\hat{u}_l) described in equation (2). Using the projected image coordinates (\hat{u}_l), we calculate the pixel-wise 2x1 translation vector {T_stn} defined in the STN (similar to the flow field). Because we warp the image based on the projected coordinates, we set the 2x2 rotation matrix {R_stn} defined in the STN as the identity matrix. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
