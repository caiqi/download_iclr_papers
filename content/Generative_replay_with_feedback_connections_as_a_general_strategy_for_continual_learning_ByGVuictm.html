Recently, numerous methods have been proposed for continual learning, but due to differences in evaluation protocols it is difficult to directly compare their performance. To enable more meaningful comparisons, we identified three distinct continual learning scenarios based on whether task identity is known and, if it is not, whether it needs to be inferred. Performing the split and permuted MNIST task protocols according to each of these scenarios, we found that regularization-based approaches (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) failed when task identity needed to be inferred. In contrast, generative replay combined with distillation (i.e., using class probabilities as ''soft targets'') achieved superior performance in all three scenarios. In addition, we reduced the computational cost of generative replay by integrating the generative model into the main model by equipping it with generative feedback connections. This Replay-through-Feedback approach substantially shortened training time with no or negligible loss in performance. We believe this to be an important first step towards making the powerful technique of generative replay scalable to real-world continual learning applications.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">continual learning, generative models, replay, distillation, feedback connections</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">A structured comparison of recent methods for continual learning that turns into an argument for and extension of generative replay.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJe-qMJA37" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An incremental method on lifelong learning.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByGVui0ctm&amp;noteId=rJe-qMJA37"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper346 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper346 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper summarizes previous lifelong learning methods and identifies three different continual learning scenarios. Based on that, it draws a conclusion that DGR+distill outperforms other methods on all these scenarios. Further, the paper proposes unified model that combines a replay generator and a classification model. The proposed RTF model achieves comparable performance with DGR+distill and is approximately two times faster than DGR+distill.

My biggest concern is the novelty of the model, since RTF is still a replay-based method that is very similar as DGR+distill. Empirically it can be expected that RTF should behave similar as DGR+distill as well. And the result in this paper justifies that. So the main contribution comes from the efficiency boost by the integrated model strategy. That is, by replacing a separate generative model by a symmetric VAE. Besides that, there seem to be no significant contribution of the proposed model.

In my opinion, this paper look somewhat incremental. The first five pages are mostly reviews of previous methods, and the model it propose behave very similar to a previous method.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1xLojt927" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>VAE with additional softmax classification layer for continual learning</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByGVui0ctm&amp;noteId=B1xLojt927"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper346 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper346 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">summary: The paper claims to make three contributions
1. It surveys the current literature on preventing catastrophic forgetting during lifelong learning. It explains the apparent inconsistencies in reported results by distinguishing three types of deployment scenarios, categorizing the evaluation procedures in the literature accordingly.
2. The paper conducts two sets of simulated experiments on MNIST data to understand which existing methods (do not) work well. It finds that deep generative replay (DGR) that learns to generate imaginary new samples from previously seen training data, potentially augmented with soft labels seems to work best in these specific experiments but potentially doubles the computational cost. 
3. To reduce computational cost without sacrificing much accuracy it proposes to integrate the ability to learn to generate imaginary samples into the learning of the classifier itself. It does this by augmenting a symmetrical VAE with a softmax classification layer connected to the final hidden layer of the encoder. 

Comments about significance:
1. I'm not entirely sure if the paper does a good job separating contributions 2 &amp; 3 above cleanly so that each can stand on its own and be fully trust-worthy.  
2. In particular, the experimental evaluation depends on the NN architectures chosen. Here the choice of architectures that were used for the best performing approach in the experiment (DGR &amp; the classifier) were simply combined together to motivate the new approach. However, this feels a bit too simplistic. for example, what would happen if you replaced the simple 2-hidden-layer NN with a much more sophisticated network for each classifier, but still had a simple VAE to generate samples? the combination is no longer likely to be this easy but it would likely work more accurately than anything shown in table 3. 

Novelty: This reviewer feels that augmenting a 2-hidden-layer VAE with a softmax classification layer does not seem to be a very significant new contribution by itself. The fact that it is being motivated for the specific problem of reducing catastrophic forgetting during lifelong learning is the main novelty here, but the relative amount of novelty might to be somewhat limited when viewed from this perspective. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_ryx-aMn_hQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>The comparison study needs some more detail, the RtF part is not significant enough.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByGVui0ctm&amp;noteId=ryx-aMn_hQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper346 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper346 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper points out a important issue in current continual learning literature: Due to the different settings and different evaluation protocols of each method, comparison between methods are usually not fair, and lead to distinct conclusions.
The paper is in general easy to understand except a few drawbacks listed in the cons.

Pros:
1. This paper investigates an important problem, aka, how does the methods compare to each other with the same evaluation protocol.
2. Experiments are performed on the previous methods, which could be used as a baseline for future works in this field.
3. Proposes to combine discriminative model with generative model to save computation when using generative model to store rehearsal examples.

Cons:
1. Details of each experiments are missing. 
Different methods are evaluated under the "incremental task learning", "incremental domain learning",  "incremental class learning" settings. However, to my knowledge, some of the methods will not work under all of the three settings, as the author also suggest that XdG only works with task id. However, I think there are a few more. For example, the LwF methods has multiple sets of output neurons, which implicitly assumes the task id is known. It is not described in the paper how to evaluate it under "incremental domain learning", aka, how to decide which set of output to use if task id is not available during testing. Another example, the results in table 3 and 4 indicates that EWC with task id is better than without. However, original EWC does not take task id during testing, it is not described how to introduce dependency on the task id for EWC.
2. Using the term feedback connection is misleading to the reader since the described method is just using an encoder/decoder structure. In my opinion this is different from feedback connection in which higher layer is an input for lower layers. Autoencoder or encoder/decoder structure is more appropriate.
3. There is some contribution in the RtF part, namely the saved computation compared to DGR. However, subjectively, I think this contribution is not very significant. The same thing can be achieved with DGR by sharing the network between the discriminative model and the discriminator in GAN. In my opinion this is more a design bonus in using generative replay than a major methodology innovation.

Conclusion:
The first part that compares different methods is worth publishing given more details are provided. I'm more than happy to give a higher score if the authors are able to provide more details and the details are reasonable.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
