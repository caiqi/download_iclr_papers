The basic idea of the methods is to track and properly make use of the first and/or second moments of the gradient for model-parameter updates over iterations for the purpose of removing the need for manual interference. In this work, we propose a new adaptive gradient method, referred to as generalized adaptive moment estimation (Game). From a high level perspective, the new method introduces two more parameters w.r.t. AMSGrad (S. J. Reddi &amp; Kumar (2018)) and one more parameter w.r.t. PAdam (Chen &amp; Gu (2018)) to enlarge the parameter- selection space for performance enhancement while reducing the memory cost per iteration compared to AMSGrad and PAdam. The saved memory space amounts to the number of model parameters, which is significant for large-scale DNNs. Our motivation for introducing additional parameters in Game is to provide algorithmic flexibility to facilitate a reduction of the performance gap between training and validation datasets when training a DNN. Convergence analysis is provided for applying Game to solve both convex optimization and smooth nonconvex optmization. Empirical studies for training four convolutional neural networks over MNIST and CIFAR10 show that under proper parameter selection, Game produces promising validation performance as compared to AMSGrad and PAdam.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">adaptive moment estimation, SGD, AMSGrad</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">A new adaptive gradient method is proposed for effectively training deep neural networks</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">5 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1g079Mhhm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A paper literally combined results from our papers </a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJxFrs09YQ&amp;noteId=B1g079Mhhm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">04 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper107 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">I am the author of two key papers (Zhou et al. (2018) <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05671.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05671.pdf</a>  and Chen &amp; Gu (2018) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06763.pdf) cited in this submission. The way this paper is written makes me really upset. 

This paper is heavily built up on our papers, and literally copied a huge part of the theorems and proofs from our paper (even the layout of the equations such as equation breaks, term decomposition is highly similar to our proofs). For example, the following sentences/paragraphs/notations are copied from our papers, i.e., Zhou et al. (2018) and Chen &amp; Gu (2018):

1. In Theorem 2, the authors present their upper bound for \|\nabla f(x_{out})\|_2 by several constant parameters M_i. Compared with Theorem 3.3 in Zhou et al. (2018), the definition of M_i and the upper bound itself are highly similar to what Theorem 3.3 in Zhou et al. (2018) presents. 

2. In the proof of Theorem 2, the use of notation is essentially the same as the proof of Theorem 3.3, section A.1 in Zhou et al. (2018). For instance, both of these two works set the output point as x_{out}, set the upper bound for \|\nabla f(x)\|_2 as G_\infty, etc.

3. The main proof roadmap for Theorem 2 is the same as the proof roadmap for Theorem 3.3 in Zhou et al. (2018). Both of these two work aim to bound \|\nabla f(x_t)\|_2^2 by the difference of H(t+1) and H(t), where H(t) = f(z_t) + \frac{G_\infty^2}{1-\beta_1}\|\alpha_{t-1}\hat{v}_{t-1}^{-p}\|_1. To get the bound, both of these two work provide upper bounds for \sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_t^2 \mathcal{E} \|\hat{V}_t^{-p} m_t\|_2^2 and \sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_t^2 \mathcal{E} \|\hat{V}_t^{-p} g_t\|_2^2. However, the authors did not point out this part of proof is essentially a twist of our proof.

4. In the proof of Theorem 2, the equation (27) at page 13 is essentially the same as the equation (A.13) at page 13 in Zhou et al. (2018), without appropriate reference. 

5. In the proof of Theorem 2, the equation (28) at page 13 is essentially the same as the equation (A.14) at page 14 in Zhou et al. (2018), without appropriate reference. 

6. In the proof of Theorem 2, the equation (29) at page 13 is essentially the same as the equation (A.15) at page 14 in Zhou et al. (2018), without appropriate reference.

Firstly in the introduction, we claim two contributions, where the 2nd one is about removing the constraint of beta_1 and beta_2 in theoretical analysis. In the main context of Section 4, we emphasize the 2nd constribution rather than a new convergence analysis approach. 

We indeed followed one of your two papers on nonconvex convergence analysis, which is put in the appendix for the readers to understand the derivation procedure. In the revision, we will carefully reshape the proof for Theorem 2 to point out the original innovation of your research work.

------

The authors propose an adaptation of the Adam method, with the AMSGrad correction and an additional parameter to p to exponentiate the diagonal conditioning matrix V (Padam).

The proposed method changes two aspects: first, there is no need to retain two version of the rescaling matrix v, where amsgrad and Padam keeps the last monotone \hat v)t and non-monotone version v_t. Secondly, a new parameter q is introduced, that replaces the q=2 in the moment estimation phase of (P)Adam.

A regret analysis is proposed in the convex case, while a vanishing bound on the gradient is derived in the non-convex smooth case.

Review
------

Although improving optimization methods is certainly important for the machine learning community, the reviewer have strong concerns about this paper.

First of all, the paper is hard to read as it contains too many approximations. What does 'SGD is known to work reasonably well regardless of their problem structure' means ? Same thing for 'Its performance deteriorates when the gradients are dense due to a rapid decay of the learning rates.' The authors uses many times elliptical discourse to detail the course of their analysis, which is non informative: for instance, 'one can easily derive the upper bound expression', and 'It is not difficult to conclude that when G_t [...]'. This level of writing is not professional. Some completely irrelevant argument are proposed to justify the method: 'For instance the extension from l_2 norm to l_p norm and generalization from Cauchy-Schwart to Holder inequality'.

The reviewer has interrogations about the relevance of the proposed algorithm. The additional parameter q needs to be tuned, which carries only the promise of further overfitting. I would have been convinced by an sequence of experiment where q is set automatically by considering a validation set, and then tested on a left out test set. However, the authors report only the results for the best q, with non significant differences (and not quantified, there is no result tables). Using q=2 at least made sense from the point of view of empirical Fisher matrix approximation.

The review also have several concerns aout the correctness of the proposed arguments. First, the major argument of memory usage stems from 1) a miscalculation and 2) a misunderstanding of memory bottlenecks in deep learning. 1) adam models keeps in memory x_t (the model parameter), g_t (the model gradient), m_t (momentum) \hat v_t and v_{t-1} (the monotone and non monotone version of the second order moment estimation. In contrast, the proposed model do not track v_{t-1}: this amounts to a memory saving of 20% considering all model related parameters. 2) more importantly, the most important memory usage in deep leaning comes from the activations that need to be kept in memory during the forward pass to perform the backward pass. Even the biggest model are less than 1GB, and most of the memory used during training is dedicated to intermediary activations. This makes the major argument of the paper less convincing, and misleads the reader.

Second, even when disregarding the slightly abusive assumptions over the iterate sequences, that are common in the adaptive stochastic optimizers community, I think that the bound proposed in theorem 1 is non informative, as the second term behaves like T sqrt(T) assymptotically, due to the presence of 1 / \alpha_t. This does not show the convergence of averaged regret R_T / T.

Regarding the experiment section, I am afraid that testing a new optimizer over MNIST and CIFAR is not enough to show the relevance of the method for the whole deep learning community. An eperiment over a non-toy dataset (eg ImageNet), and on non computer-vision dataset (eg from NLP) would be a minimum, besides the overfitting concern described above.

In conclusion, it is the reviewer's opinion that significant rework in term of presentation and strong improvement of the experiment section to make the case for the Game optimizer.

Minor comments
------------
Table 1: what do you bound when you compare results ? I think there is a typo in Zhou et al. result: 1/2 should read p.

Eq (1): it is rather surprising to use x_t as the model parameters in the ICLR community. 

p 7: the dimension d could be larger than T when training large-scale neural networks: how does it relate to comparing sqrt(dT) to (dT)^s ?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: Clear rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_ByeOrl6FhX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>This paper proposes a new framework that generalizes previous algorithms such as AMSGrad and PAdam.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJxFrs09YQ&amp;noteId=ByeOrl6FhX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper107 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper107 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Pros:
1. The algorithm saves about 1/3 memory consumption compared with AMSGrad.
2. The authors give the proof that the generalized algorithms have the same convergence rate with weaker assumptions.

Cons:
1. All the experiments are based on CNN. There are no results based on modern deep neural networks such as Residual Nets and Dense Nets, where it is obvious to see Adam suffers from poor generalization. 

2. Algorithms like SGD with momentum and Adam should be included for comparison.

3. This framework introduces two more hyper-parameters p and q, which makes it more difficult for practitioners to tune.

Although this framework has proven convergence in both convex and non-convex smooth cases, the experimental evidence is limited. In addition, the proof strategy is not novel enough, Theorem 1 is similar to Theorem 4 in AMSGrad paper and Theorem 2 is similar to Theorem 3.3 in Zhou et al's paper.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SyxOce_LhQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>acceptable</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJxFrs09YQ&amp;noteId=SyxOce_LhQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper107 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">31 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper107 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors proposed a generalized adaptive moment estimation method(Game).
