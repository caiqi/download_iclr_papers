Once a systematic name for a chemical compound is given, it will naturally and much simply convert the name into the eventually required molecular formula. However, for many chemical substances, they have been shown in many other names besides their systematic names which poses a great challenge for this task. In this paper, we propose a framework to do the auto standardization from the non-systematic names to the corresponding systematic names by using the spelling error correction, byte pair encoding tokenization and neural sequence to sequence model. Our framework is trained end to end and is fully data-driven. Our standardization accuracy on the test dataset achieves 54.04% which has a great improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art result.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Chemical Names Standardization, Byte Pair Encoding, Sequence to Sequence Model</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We designed an end-to-end framework using sequence to sequence model to do the  chemical names standardization.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">8 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1eip-5ZRm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>About the novelty of our paper</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_NjCqtX&amp;noteId=r1eip-5ZRm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper15 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">20 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper15 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">We acknowledge that our system has not introduced new models or components. However, this work still earns its merits by effectively formulizing such a chemical name processing problem into a machine translation task, which is not a trivial or straightforward solution from the problem form.  Our final and true purpose is to convert  chemimcal names with errors into its 3D forms, which is absolutely a non-trivial task for any known machine learning problem. Our main contribution is to effectively decompose such a problem and re-formulize the task into a machine translation one between error names and correct exact names. As this work is open, maybe it seems easy and staightforward, but it comes non-trivial problem and long-term unsuccessful attempts, and more importantly, it solves a long-term unsolved problem which is very needed in the current chemical inforrmation processing.
Overall, we report the first system for such a task that can give results with practical value. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BkxNVq9aT7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Modification of papers</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_NjCqtX&amp;noteId=BkxNVq9aT7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper15 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">17 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper15 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">First of all, many thanks to all the valuable comments from the reviewers.

In the chemical literature, the same chemical could be referred to by many different names. This work focusses on standardizing non systematic names (for example Asprin to 2-Acetoxybenzoic acid). 

The authors approach this as a machine translation problem. They create a parallel corpus of non-systematic and systematic names and build a seq2seq model for accomplishing this task. The authors report accuracy and BLEU score for the translation task.

My main concern with this work is novelty. It seems like this is a straightforward application of an existing model for this task. Also it is not clear why BLEU score is an appropriate metric for this task. Is it okay for downstream applications to have the systematic name partially right?

Overall, I think this paper does not present substantially new ideas to merit publication.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SJgIbOcp6X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>We still have important contribution</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_NjCqtX&amp;noteId=SJgIbOcp6X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper15 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">17 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper15 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thank you for your valuable comments. Although our work uses the existing models, our main contribution is that we combine these methods and create a pipeline to solve an import problem. We also prove that spelling error correction is useful for this application and we can extend this technique to all other domains which leverage the seq2seq model like neural machine translation. As you have mentioned, only a fully correct chemical name is useful for downstream application so we report also the accuracy of our method which is the key valuation metric. As for the BLEU score, it is widely used in machine translation. As mentioned in the paper, our task shares many similarities with machine translation task so BLEU score can provide another perspective to evaluate the result.

It's not my area, but I was frankly surprised when the paper said there was only one relevant prior piece of work, but having searched for a few minutes on Google Scholar, I'm at least inclined to believe that the authors are (approximately) right on that one. (This stands in stark contradistinction to the large quantity of biomedical entity recognition and linking work.) So, it's valuable to have work in this area, and the approach and application are sensible. In one sense, this gives the work significance and originality (as to domain). The paper is also clearly written, and certainly sufficiently accessible to an ML reader.

Cons: Unfortunately, though, I just don't think this qualifies for acceptance at ICLR. It's application of known techniques, and lacks any ML novelty or sufficient ML interest. It would only be appropriate for an "ML applications" track, which ICLR does not have. And while its performance is _way_ better than that of the only previous work on the topic that they know, accuracy of mapping non-systematic chemical terms (54.04%) is still low enough that this technique doesn't seem ready for prime time. 

Other comments: In table 5, you show that a prior pipeline stage of spelling correction is definitely useful in your system (table 5). And yet, given the power of deep learning seq2seq transductions, and the potential to use them for spelling correction, one might wonder whether this prior step of spelling correction is really necessary. It might be interesting to explore further where it helps and whether the gains of spelling correction might be obtainable in other ways such as using data augmentation (such as spelling error insertion) in the seq2seq training data. The Golebiewski bib entry is lacking any information as to where it is published, which seems especially bad for the key citation to prior work of the whole paper. In general, the bibliography has issues: non-ASCII characters have been lost (you either need to LaTeX-escape them or to load a package like utf8, and capitalization of acronyms, etc. should be improved with curly braces.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: Clear rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HyxWndcpp7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Add the experiment of data augmentation</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJg_NjCqtX&amp;noteId=HyxWndcpp7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper15 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">17 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper15 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">We appreciate a lot that you have affirmed that our work is one of the few works on this domain. Although the accuracy we achieve currently is still high enough, we have made an enormous progress compared to the previous method. As chemical name standardization is a very difficult problem, our work can serve as a strong baseline for the future research. For the spelling error correction, the idea of making the neural model to learn how to correct the spelling error is very interesting so we add an experiment using the data augmentation as you have mentioned. It achieves an accuracy of 52.95% and a BLEU score of 69.00. It is lower than the spelling error correction model (54.05%) but higher than the baseline (49.94%), which suggests that the data augmentation does work but does not perform as well as spelling error correction that we propose. We report this result (table 5) and the experiment details (section 3.1) in the updated version of our paper.

Beyond that, a corpus of systematic and non-systematic chemical names is introduced that were extracted from chemistry and manually labelled.

The paper is well-structured and the authors introduce the problem setting very nicely to a machine learning audience, explain the challenges and motivate the architecture of their model. The model is a combination of tested approaches such as a spelling error correction, a byte pair encoding tokenizer and a sequence-to-sequence model consisting of (Bi)LSTMs and attention mechanisms. 

The evaluation appears solid. The model achieves significantly improved results on the proposed corpus, even though compared to a underwhelming baseline. The analysis could be improved by showing and explaining some examples of failed translation attempts. It would also be interesting to see how the failed attempts are distributed over the error types (spelling, order, common name, synonym). The authors suggest a scenario where non-systematic names are converted and checked against a database of systematic names. For this, it would be interesting to know whether there are cases where a non-systematic name was translated into the wrong (but valid) systematic name.

Concluding, the paper presents an interesting application for machine translation, a new dataset and a method that successfully labels 50% of the given corpus.

Because of the huge amount of data, we cannot check the error type of failed attempts one by one so we randomly select 100 fail attempts and label their error types manually and carefully. The result is reported in the section 3.4 of the updated version of our paper, in which some failed translation examples are also added. For the scenario, we admit that there could be the case where a non-systematic name is translated into the wrong (but valid) systematic name. For the preciseness, we delete this statement in the updated version of our paper.
