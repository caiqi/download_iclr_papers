As an active research topic, many GAN variants have emerged with immprovements in sample quality and training stability. However, visualization and understanding of GANs is largely missing. How does a GAN represent our visual world internally?  What causes the artifacts in GAN results?  How do architectural choices affect GAN learning?  Answering such questions could enable us to develop new insights and better models.

In this work, we present an analytic framework to visualize and understand GANs at the unit-, object-, and scene-level. We first identify a group of interpretable units that are closely related to \concepts with a segmentation-based network dissection method. Then, we quantify the causal effect of interpretable units by measuring the ability of interventions to control objects in the output. Finally, we examine the contextual relationship between these units and their surrounding by inserting the discovered \concepts into new images. We show several practical applications enabled by our framework, from comparing internal representations across different layers, models, and datasets, to improving GANs by locating and  removing ``artifacts'' units, to interactively manipulating objects in the scene.  We will open source our interactive online tools to help  researchers and practitioners better understand their models.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">GAN representations are examined in detail, and sets of representation units are found that control the generation of semantic concepts in the output.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">GANs, representation, interpretability, causality</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rylRgFDnnQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>New methods for interpreting GANs, with nice practical contribution for improving GANs outputs.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyg_X2C5FX&amp;noteId=rylRgFDnnQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1371 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">04 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1371 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper proposes a method for visualizing and understanding GANs representation. This seems an important topic as several such methods were performed for networks trained in supervised learning, which relate
to the predicted outcome, but there is lack of methods for interpreting GANs which are learned in an unsupervised manner and it is generally unclear what is the representation learned by GANs. 
The method is finding correlations between the appearance of objects and the activation of units in each layer of the learned network. 
In addition, the paper presents a 'causal' measure, where a causal effect of a unit is measured by removing and adding this unit from/to the network and computing the average effect on object appearance.
The authors demonstrate how the methods are applied by improving the appearance of images, by modifying units which were detected as important for specific objects. 
The authors also provide an interactive interface where users can manually examine and modify their trained GANs in order to add/remove objects and to remove artifacts. 

The method proposed by the authors seem to be appropriate for convolutional neural networks, where 'units' in each layer may correspond to objects and can be searched for in particular locations of image. 
It is not clear to me if and how one can apply the author's methods to other architecture, and to other application domains (besides images), or whether the method is limited to vision applications. 
The authors do not explain specifically how do they choose the 'units' for which they seek interpretation when reporting their results. It is written that each layer is divided into two sets: 
u  and u-bar, where we seek interpretation of u. But how large does u tend to be? how would one choose it? is it one filter out of all filters in a certain layer? when optimizing for sets of units together
(using the alpha probabilities and the optimization in eq. 6) what is d? is it performed for all units in a single layer? more details would be useful here. 

The paper is overall clearly written, with lots of visual examples demonstrating the methods presented in it. 
The paper presents a new methodological idea, which allows for nice practical contribution. There is no theoretical contribution or any deep analysis. 
There is no reference in the paper to the supp. info. figures and therefore it is not clear if and how the supp. info. adds valuable information to the reader. 
The authors use scores like SWD and FIT for performance, but give no explanations for what do these scores measure.

This work proposes a novel analytic framework exploited on a semantic segmentation model to visualize GANs at unit (feature map) level. The authors show that some GAN representations can be interpreted, correlate with the parsing result from the semantic segmentation model but as variables that have a causal effect on the synthesis of semantic objects in the output. This framework could allow to detect and remove the artifacts to improve the quality of the generated images.

The paper is well-written and organized. The dissection and intervention for finding relationships between representation units and objects are simple, straightforward and meaningful. The visualizations are convincing and insightful. I recommend to accept the paper.

## Detail comments
About diagnosing and improving GANs, please give more details of the human annotation for the artifacts.

I think there is a typo in the first and second paragraphs in section 4.3, Figure 14 -&gt; Figure 8.  

The whole framework is based on a semantic segmentation model. The model is highly possibly imperfect and could have very different performances on different objects. Have you ever considerate to handle these imperfect models?

Is there a way to apply the framework to the training process of GANs?

To achieve this, they first find a group of interpretable units and then quantify the causal effect of interpretable units. Finally, the contextual relationship between these units and their surrounding is examined by inserting the discovered object concepts into new images. Extensive experiments are presented and a video is provided.

Overall, I think this paper is very valuable and well-written. The experiments clearly show the questions proposed in the introduction are answered. Two concerns are as follows.

Cons:
1) The visualization seems to be very heuristic. What I want to know is the theoretical interpretation of the visualization. For example, the Class Activation Maps (CAM) can be directly calculated by the output values of softmax function. How about the visual class for the generative neural networks?
2) I am also very curious, how is the rate of finding the correct sets of units for a particular visual class?
