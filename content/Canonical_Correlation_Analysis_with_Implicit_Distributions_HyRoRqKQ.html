Due to the conjugacy of the prior and the likelihood, probabilistic CCA (PCCA) presents the posterior with an analytic solution, which provides probabilistic interpretation for classic linear CCA. As the multi-view data are usually complex in practice, nonlinear mappings are adopted to capture nonlinear dependency among the views. However, the interpretation provided in PCCA cannot be generalized to this nonlinear setting, as the distribution assumptions on the prior and the likelihood makes it restrictive to capture nonlinear dependency. To overcome this bottleneck, in this paper, we provide a novel perspective for CCA based on implicit distributions. Specifically, we present minimum Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) as a new criteria to capture nonlinear dependency for multi-view learning problem. To eliminate the explicit distribution requirement in direct estimation of CMI, we derive an objective whose minimization implicitly leads to the proposed criteria. Based on this objective, we present an implicit probabilistic formulation for CCA, named Implicit CCA (ICCA), which provides a flexible framework to design CCA extensions with implicit distributions. As an instantiation, we present adversarial CCA (ACCA), a nonlinear CCA variant which benefits from consistent encoding achieved by adversarial learning. Quantitative correlation analysis and superior performance on cross-view generation task demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ACCA.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Canonical Correlation Analysis, implicit probabilistic model, cross-view structure output prediction</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper presents a theoretical study for CCA based on implicit distributions and proposes a generative nonlinear CCA variant which achieves consistent encoding for the multi-view input.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HygXIrnhn7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting idea but could need more polishing</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy4R2oRqKQ&amp;noteId=HygXIrnhn7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper761 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper761 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">In this paper, the authors attempt to provide a perspective on CCA that is based on implicit distributions.  The authors compare and discuss several variants on CCA that have been proposed over the years, ranging from Linear CCA to Deep CCA and autoencoder variants.  In order to overcome the prior/likelihood distribution assumptions, the authors propose a CCA view that is based on learning implicit distributions, e.g, by using generative adversarial networks.   The authors further motivate their work by comparing with (Bi-)VCCA, claiming that the underlying assumptions lead to inconsistent constraints (or idealistic).  I think the work has merit, and I like the motivation.  Nevetheless, I think stronger experiments are required, as well as improvements in terms of clarity in the writing of the paper, and stronger support for the motivation.   Figure 2 should be better explained in text.  The MNIST experiment is useful, but using GANs usually results in sharper images than say VAE.  Also, comparisons with (i) other models besides Bi-VCCA, and (ii) on other multi-view real-world data (besides the MNIST_LR) would be very useful in terms of communicating the true benefits of this model.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HklJ3TmqnX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>More explanation of the method can improve the paper</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy4R2oRqKQ&amp;noteId=HklJ3TmqnX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper761 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper761 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes to improve deep variational canonical correlation analysis (VCCA, Bi-VCCA) by 1) applying adversarial autoencoders (Makhzani et al. ICLR 2016) to model the encoding from multiple data views (X, Y, XY) to the latent representation (Z); and 2) introducing q(z|x,y) to explicitly encode the joint distribution of two views X,Y. The proposed approach, called adversarial canonical correlation analysis (ACCA), is essentially the application of adversarial autoencoder to multiple data views. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including the MNIST left right halved dataset, MNIST noisy dataset, and Wisconsin X-ray microbeam database, show the proposed ACCA result in higher dependence (measured by the normalized HSIC) between two data views compared to Bi-VCCA. 

This paper is well motivated. Since adversarial autoencoder aims to improve based on VAE, it's natural to make use of adversarial autoencoder to improve the original VCCA. The advantage of ACCA is well supported by the experimental result.

In ACCA_NoCV, does the author use a Gaussian prior? If so, could the author provide more intuition to explain why ACCA_NoCV would outperform Bi-VCCA, which 1) also use a Gaussian prior; and 2) also does not use the complementary view XY? Why would adversarial training improve the result?

In ACCA, does the form of the prior distribution have to be specified in advance, such as Gaussian or the Gaussian mixture? Are the parameters of the prior learned during the training?

When comparing the performance of different models, besides normalized HSIC, which is a quite recent approach, does the author compute the log-likelihood on the test set for Bi-VCCA and different variants of ACCA? Which model can achieve the highest test log-likelihood?

According to equation (6), in principle, only q(z|x,y) is needed to approximate the true posterior distribution p(z|x,y). Did the author try to remove the first two terms in the right hand side of Equation (11), i.e., the expectation w.r.t. q_x(z) and q_y(z), and see how the model performance was affected?

Does adversarial training introduce longer training time compared to the Bi-VCCA?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Sye9zUNbsm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>The paper does not unambiguously describe the proposed model and algorithm.

In particular:

1) The main motivation is the minimization of the conditional mutual information I(X;Y|Z), where X and Y correspond to the two views and Z is latent. First of all, what uncertainty does this expression has when X and Y are observations and Z is given? My understanding is that the main objective of any CCA problem should be to find some transformations, say f(X) and g(Y), with some (to be defined) desirable properties. For example, these would correspond to linear transformations, say Ax and By, for classical CCA. Therefore, should not one be interested in minimizing something like I(f(X);g(Y)|Z)?

2) Assuming that the minimization of the conditional mutual information I(X;Y|Z) would be the goal, I don't quite see why the formulation in equation (6) would actually be equivalent (or be some reasonable approximation)? 

3) It is well known that differential entropy can be negative (e.g., Cover and Thomas, 2006). Why would the conditional mutual information in equation (4) be non-negative? Alternatively, what would negative values of I(X;Y|Z) mean in the CCA context? My understanding is that one should be interested in minimizing I(X;Y|Z), or its variants with transformations, in *absolute value* to ensure some closeness to conditional independence.

4) Expressions in equation (5)-(6) are general and hold with no assumptions whatsoever for any random variables X, Y, Z (given the expectations/integrals exist). It is therefore not clear what are the variables of this minimization problem? (parameters? but what is the parametric model?)

5) Assuming solving (6) is the goal, this formulation as mentioned by the authors is actually is quite a challenging problem involving latent variables. Some form of this approach explanation would 

I can not quite see how the proposed adversarial version would correct or supplement any of these questions.

Other comments:

1) It would be appropriate to cite the probabilistic CCA paper by Bach and Jordan (2005); a better citation for classical CCA would be Hotelling (1936).

2) I find the multiple mentioning of the *non-linear* (in-)dependence confusing. Is this in statistical sense? And how exactly is this related to CCA? Does it have anything to do with the fact that the third and higher order cumulants are zero only for independent variables unless they are Gaussian? Moreover, does this linear independence have any connection with the non-linearity of the proposed CCA approach?

3) What exactly is the *linear correlation criterion* and how does it enter the classical CCA or PCCA formulation (Introduction; bullet point 2)?

4) It would be helpful to introduce the original CCA problem emphasizing that each view, X and Y, are *different* linear transformation of *the same* latent codes z. Moreover, the full description of the models (classical CCA/ PCCA) wouldn't take more than one-two paragraphs and would help the readers to avoid any misunderstanding.

5) Are any assumptions necessary to ensure existence?
