In a software keyboard application on mobile devices, this translates into higher power consumption and shorter battery life. This paper represents the first attempt, to our knowledge, in exploring accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs for NLMs. Building on quasi-recurrent neural networks (QRNNs), we apply pruning techniques to provide a "knob" to select different operating points. In addition, we propose a simple technique to recover some perplexity using a negligible amount of memory. Our empirical evaluations consider both perplexity as well as energy consumption on a Raspberry Pi, where we demonstrate which methods provide the best perplexity-power consumption operating point. At one operating point, one of the techniques is able to provide energy savings of 40% over the state of the art with only a 17% relative increase in perplexity.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Inference-time pruning, Neural Language Models</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HylJTQ3b6X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Recent related work</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1GcHsAqtm&amp;noteId=HylJTQ3b6X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">08 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper112 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Hey,  I agree nlm is powerful but sometimes too slow.

While their primary effort to evaluate pruning options and compare points along the resulting tradeoff curves doesn't result in a model that would be small and fast enough to serve, the authors also introduce a clever method (single-rank weight updates) that recovers significant perplexity after pruning.

But there are many other things the authors could have tried that might have given significantly better results, or significantly improved the results they did get (the top-line 40% savings for 17% perplexity increase seems fairly weak to me). In particular:

- The QRNN architecture contains two components: convolutions alternate with a recurrent pooling operation. The fact that the authors report using a PyTorch QRNN implementation (which runs on the Arm architecture but doesn't contain a fused recurrent pooling kernel for any hardware other than NVIDIA GPUs) makes me afraid that they used a non-fused, op-by-op, approach for the pooling step, which would leave potentially 10 or 20 percentage points of free performance on the table. The QRNN architecture is designed for a situation where you already have optimized matrix multiply/convolution kernels, but where you're willing to write a simple kernel for the pooling step yourself; at the end of the day, pooling represents a tiny fraction of the QRNN's FLOPs and does not need to take more than 1 or 2 percent of total runtime on any hardware. (If you demonstrate that your implementation doesn't spend a significant amount of time on pooling, I'm happy to bump up my rating; I think this is a central point that's critical to motivating QRNN use and deployment).

- Once pooling is reduced to &lt;2% of runtime, improvements in the convolution/matmul efficiency will have increased effect on overall performance. Perhaps your pruning mechanisms improved matmul efficiency by 50%, but the fact that you're spending more time on pooling than you need to has effectively reduced that to 40%.

- Although the engineering effort would be much higher, it's worth considering block-sparse weight matrices (as described in Narang et al. (Baidu) and Gray et al. (OpenAI)). While this remains an underexplored area, it's conceivable that block-sparse kernels (which should be efficient on Arm NEON with block sizes as low as 4x4 or so) and blockwise pruning could give more than a 50% speedup in convolution/matmul efficiency.

- In a real-world application, you would probably also want to explore quantization and distillation approaches to see if they have additional efficiency gains. Overall results of 10x or more wall clock time reduction with &lt;5% loss in accuracy are typical for domains that have seen more optimization for mobile deployment (especially mobile-optimized CNNs like MobileNet), so I think that's entirely possible for your application.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BygJ8-PKhX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Nice work but I think another baseline is needed.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1GcHsAqtm&amp;noteId=BygJ8-PKhX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper112 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper112 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes to evaluate the accuracy-efficiency trade off in QRNN language model though pruning the filters using four different methods. During evaluation, it uses energy consumption on a Raspberry Pi as an efficiency metric. Directly dropping filters make the accuracy of the models worse. Then the paper proposes single-rank update(SRU) method that uses negligible amount of parameters to recover some perplexity. I like this paper focuses on model's performance on real world machines.

1) The proposed approaches just work for QRNN, but not for many other neural language models such as LSTM, vanilla RNN language models, the title could be misleading. 

2) In the experiment section, I think one baseline is needed for comparison: the QRNN language model with a smaller number of filters trained from scratch. With this baseline, we can see if the large number of filters are needed even before pruning.

In particular, they explore how different compression strategies impact the accuracy (and flops), and more interestingly, also how it impacts the power use for a RaspberryPi. The authors consider the QRNNs and SRUs for this purpose and use standard datasets for their analysis. I am torn about this paper. On one hand, I feel that the analysis is interesting, thoughtful and detailed; the power usage statistics bring a different perspective to the compression community. The section on inference time pruning was especially interesting to read. On the other hand however, there is limited novelty in the setup. The authors use standard, well known, compression algorithms on common neural language modeling architectures and datasets and use out-of-the-box tools for their ultimate analysis. Further, the paper needs additional work before it can be accepted in my opinion. I detail my arguments below:

- The authors begin by discussing SwiftKey and similar apps but I'm not sure if its clear that they use neural language modeling as the backend. Do the authors have a source to validate this claim?
- Knowledge distillation is another algorithm that has been found to be quite competitive in compressing models into smaller versions of themselves. Have the authors experimented with that? 
- The R@3 is an good metric but I suggest that the authors look at mean reciprocal rank (MRR) instead. This removes the arbitrary-ness of "3" while ensuring that the metric of interest is the accuracy and not probability of being correct (perplexity). 
- Can you comment on the sensitivity of the results to the RPi frameworks? For instance, the RPi deployment tools, architecture, and variance in the predictions? 
- Along the same line, I'm curious how generalizable the RPi results are for other computing architectures. For those of us who are not experts on hardware, it would be nice to read about whether similar tradeoffs will exist in other architectures such as mobile phones, GPUs or CPUs. 
- Could the authors add some meta-analysis about the results? If the perplexity goes up as a consequence of compression, what kinds of tokens it that localized to? Is it primarily rare words that the model is less confident about, or are the probabilities for most words getting skewed?
- Finally, I feel that such an exploration will catch on only if the tools are open-sourced and made easy to replicate/use. If there were a blog or article summarizing the steps needed to replicate the power measurement (including sources from where to buy the necessary hardware), more people would be inclined on adding such an analysis to future neural language modeling work. 

I am willing to revisit my rating, as necessary, once I read through the rebuttal. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
