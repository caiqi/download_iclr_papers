To make this learning efficient, given a curriculum and the current learning state of an agent, we need to find what are the good next tasks to train the agent on.
Teacher-Student algorithms assume that the good next tasks are the ones on which the agent is making the fastest progress or digress. We first simplify and improve them. However, two problematic situations where the agent is mainly trained on tasks it can't learn yet or it already learnt may occur.
Therefore, we introduce a new algorithm using min max ordered curriculums that assumes that the good next tasks are the ones that are learnable but not learnt yet. It outperforms Teacher-Student algorithms on small curriculums and significantly outperforms them on sophisticated ones with numerous tasks.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">learning, curriculum learning, reinforcement learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We present a new algorithm for learning by curriculum based on the notion of mastering rate that outperforms previous algorithms.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">5 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SkezSCQJp7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Reject due to lack of sufficient evaluation</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJlGdsC9Ym&amp;noteId=SkezSCQJp7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper332 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper332 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Pros:

3) Some of the justifications seem a bit strange. For eg, quoting from the paper: "Why this assumption? Because it can't be otherwise"

The presence of the acknowledgment section with people's names is completely stupid... Is it eliminatory?

We completely understand that you don't want to spend too much time on a paper that is not worth attention. However, your review is not currently very useful for us. So, regarding your review, we would be glad to have your view on the following questions:

- You qualify the writing as "poor". Is it poor because "There are only 7 references. The experimental results are limited to toy tasks, and the result section has only 8 lines.", or is it poor for other reasons? In the last case, could you give us some clues on how to improve it?

- You don't appreciate the few number of references. We cited only the very relevant papers and  prefered (probably wrongly) to correctly present (in few pages) the theory. Is it eliminatory? Is it a so bad idea?

- You don't appreciate the use of only toys environment. We chose such environments for several reasons:

1. As far as we know, Gym-MiniGrid is the only library allowing to easily design tasks and hence create curriculums.
2. In order to evaluate the quality of a curriculum algorithm, no need to have tasks that look complex (such as the game of Go, etc...), but only to have tasks that are very hard (or impossible to learn) alone (e.g. toy tasks with a small max_step threshold).
3. Not taking toy tasks makes the whole process very slow for no reason. This doesn't help to evaluate the quality of the curriculum algorithm.
4. With just toy tasks, we can show our algorithm performs better.

Do you think these arguments are admissible? If yes, should we make them appear in the paper?

- You don't appreciate the very short result section. What is missing inside? We showed how our algorithm outperformed the other algorithm on two different curriculums.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJe35ALmnm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Limited experiments, limited justifications, requires additional knowledge</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJlGdsC9Ym&amp;noteId=HJe35ALmnm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper332 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">29 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper332 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">[The acknowledgment section might be violating the blind review.]

This paper claims to simplify and improve recently proposed automatic curriculum learning methods. Their experiments in section 4 are very limited to a single setup and most of the simplifications are not well-justified by any new results. Their proposed algorithm in section 5 assumes the presence of addition ordering information about tasks which needs a more thorough comparison to other related works.

Section 4 introduces some simplifications. They “recommend” a few choices by referencing the figures in [2], essentially reiterating the contributions of [2] and presenting no new results. Then they propose modifications to \eps-greedy with window algorithm of [1] by presenting results on one task. They propose to remove the moving average and essentially reintroducing the naive algorithm of [2].

Section 5 proposes a new algorithm that relies on a additional knowledge of ordering of tasks. It based on a measure called “mastering rate” for a task that it is converted to an “attention” value by incorporating the ordering information. Attention values are propagated in one extra step.

Positives:
MR algorithm might be good but no compelling experiments are presented.

Negatives:
- The experiments are limited to one set of tasks introduced by this work. It is not clear if it is a good benchmark for automated curriculum learning. Section 4 does not compare to any method that does not perform any automated curriculum learning.
- Fig. 6 and 7, the main figures of this paper, show that the baseline gets almost zero reward in most of the experiments. Basically, they are beating a weak baseline without explaining why it has failed. Maybe other algorithms in the previous work would work better in this setting.
- There is a mistake in analyzing the algorithm of [1]. [1] does not exactly fit in Teacher-Student framework because they use Exp3.S policy that combines Boltzmann exploration with an \eps-greedy strategy. They also have a hyperparameter \eta that acts as the temperature of the softmax.
- There is no ablation study on the importance and effect of each of the last 2 steps of the MR algorithm (Eq. 1, 2, 3). Does one need the ordering?
- Works such as [3] are also related because of the use of additional ordering information.
