They define a "weak contraction map," argue that it will have a unique fixed point, and use this to propose a zeroth order optimization algorithm which iteratively identifies sublevel sets of the objective until convergence to the optimum.

At each iteration $t$, the $f(x_t)$-sublevel set of $f$ is found using a root-finding algorithm, and the next point $x_{t+1}$ is calculated by averaging a collection of points on the boundary of the sublevel set.

My main concern about this paper is that the optimization algorithm works neither in theory nor in realistic practical scenarios. There are two main issues:
(1) Identifying the sublevel sets requires solving equations of the form $f(x) = L$, which is just as hard as optimizing $f$ in the first place! In many realistic scenarios, e.g. machine learning problems, you know what the minimum value of the function is, so you could just solve $f(x) = f^*$ and be done in one step! Even if you don't know the optimal value, you could do some version of binary search. Also, for the two or three dimensional problems with relatively simple expressions that the authors experimented on, finding roots might be possible, but for higher dimensions or more complicated functions, finding these roots would require numerical optimization--which is the problem we are trying to solve in the first place.
(2) The authors seem to imply that this algorithm would work for any $f$, however, consider the function in 1 dimension $f(x) = 1$ for all $x \neq x^*$, and $f(x^*) = 0$. For this function, the $f(x_t)$-sublevel sets are the entire domain until $x_t = x^*$. It is unclear what "points on the contours" would mean in this case, but whatever those contours are, the algorithm would never converge on this function because the function value of $x_0, x_1, ...$ would all be the same, so the contours would remain the same. This function might seem a little ridiculous, but continuous or even Lipschitz version of this counterexample could be constructed by smoothing things out around $x^*$, and a function such as this could be obfuscated by writing it down with a long, complicated expression making it hard to identify $x^*$ by inspection.

There are some typos/typesetting issues. It seems that all of the theorem and lemma statements in Section 2 are missing the bold "Theorem" and "Lemma" heading. In the paragraph after equation (2), "weak contraction mapping" is defined twice, I believe the first definition should be just a "contraction mapping."</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">1: Trivial or wrong</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HkeFledC3X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Some clarification</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygJSiA5YQ&amp;noteId=HkeFledC3X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper49 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper49 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thank you for your reading and comments. 

I have some clarification with regard to the comments: 

1) I can see your point that some root-finding algorithm is based on or related to optimization. While the implementation of root-finding algorithm is not the scope of discussion. In other words, the logic and argument in this paper could be " give there is a reliable root-finding algorithm, it is possible to build a contraction map to find the global optimum". The package I am using for root finding is "Math/MultiRootFinder.h" and "Math/WrappedMultiTF1.h" of ROOT software;

2) For the function $f(X) = 1$, it is possible build some non-expansive map, but not weak contraction map. There is a requirement for weak contraction map that " D(X_{i+1} &lt; q D(X_{i})$, which guarantee the existence of fixed-point. In other words, it also requires or indicates the objective function has a unique minimum but don's need to be convex.

My point is that, if you have a reliable root-finding algorithm, there is no need to build a weak contraction map in the first place, you can simply find the optimum using the root finder. In many cases, the minimum value is a known value f* (e.g. in machine learning the optimum is typically f*=0) so you can optimize by finding the root f(x) = f*. Even if that is not the case, you can perform some kind of "binary search" on the value using a small number of calls to the root finding algorithm. 

Regarding 2), the function I suggested was f(x) = 1 for x \neq x* and f(x*) = 0, so there is still a unique minimizer. The issue is that in order to make the weak contraction map that converges to x*, your sets X_1,X_2,... all need to contain x*, and the need to keep zooming in until they contain only x*. However, unless you already know what x* is, I don't see how you could ensure that you will keep zooming in on it. And if you do know what x* is, you don't need to optimize in the first place.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJlE1rck6X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>clarification</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygJSiA5YQ&amp;noteId=rJlE1rck6X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper49 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">07 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper49 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">
1) In general case, the minimum value is not known value(unless intend to overfit the data) because the degree of freedom of objective function is limited by the number of parameters and the way objective function formed.  The objective function can be very close or like to the data but not exactly the same. 

Yes, if this algorithm is regarded as some kind of "binary search" in high dimensional space. Then the paper is trying to explain the mechanism of the "binary search" and why it can converge to the global minimum as an extension of Banach fixed point theorem especially in the case that the objective function has many minima. Therefore, the novelty of this paper is focused on the extension of Banach fixed point theorem or the variation with respect to Banach fixed point theorem. 

2)For the function f(x)=1, indeed any x in the domain is a minimizer but it is not a unique minimizer. It is possible to build non-expansive mapping rather than contraction mapping.  Solutions exists for this case but they are not unique.  And this is not the scope of this paper. The weak contraction mapping is proposed that trying to find the global minimum point that the objective function has a unique global minimum but not has to be convex. Ackley function is a good example. The paper shows that it is possible to make the range of the mapping shrink to a point. 

I corrected the typesetting and updated the manuscript.  I hope the updated version can help to clarify some existing misunderstanding.

The idea may have its merits, but in the present form, it is not acceptable.

Notably, the key definition of the paper, that is that of the weak contraction mapping (starting with "Then a mapping T : X → X is called weak") is incomplete, because it uses a \mathcal{R}, which is never defined. This makes it hard to evaluate any of the results. 

Further, there is no clear separation between text and theorems. Worse, the theorems are not self-contained. E.g. what could perhaps be Theorem 2 (Starting with "x* is a fixed-point of T in X0.") does not define x*.

While I cannot be certain because of the reasons stated above, the authors seem to have had in mind something like the Kakutani theorem:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakutani_fixed-point_theorem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakutani_fixed-point_theorem</a>
which they don't cite. Their assumptions on the map are weaker than that of Kakutani (upper hemicontinuity), which makes me a bit doubtful as to whether the statements could be proven, even if made precise. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1xAcYdC3Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Thank you + reply </a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygJSiA5YQ&amp;noteId=H1xAcYdC3Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper49 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper49 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">
Thank you for your reading and comments. 

The \mathcal{R} means the range of the map T. And the fixed-point is the point that x* = T(x*). 

Thank you for pointing out the part not well defined.
