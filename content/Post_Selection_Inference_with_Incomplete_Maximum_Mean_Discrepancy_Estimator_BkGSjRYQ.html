Furthermore, in the era of big data, designing divergence measure that is interpretable and can handle high-dimensional and complex data becomes extremely important. In this paper, we propose a post selection inference (PSI) framework for divergence measure, which can select a set of statistically significant features that discriminate two distributions. Specifically, we employ an additive variant of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for features and introduce a general hypothesis test for PSI. A novel MMD estimator using the incomplete U-statistics, which has an asymptotically normal distribution (under mild assumptions) and gives high detection power in PSI, is also proposed and analyzed theoretically. Through synthetic and real-world feature selection experiments, we show that the proposed framework can successfully detect statistically significant features. Last, we propose a sample selection framework for analyzing different members in the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) family. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Maximum Mean Discrepancy, Selective Inference, Feature Selection, GAN</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">9 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BkxV1bD02Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Could be an important contribution but not clear from the paper</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkG5SjR5YQ&amp;noteId=BkxV1bD02Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper111 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper111 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper proposes a new post selection inference for MMD statistics, i.e., identity the p-values for the dimensions of vector.

However, I wish the paper could have explained the main idea clearly. Right now it is hard to me to judge whether or not the proposed estimator is correct (the only place that seems to support this is Fig. 4(a). Where the p-value seems to be clear to a uniform distribution.

&gt;However, I wish the paper could have explained the main idea clearly. Right now it is hard to me to judge whether or not the proposed estimator is correct (the only place that seems to support this is Fig. 4(a). Where the p-value seems to be clear to a uniform distribution. 

The main idea is to use an estimator of MMD with normal response to perform testing and selective inference. The proposed incomplete estimator randomly subsamples the U-stats kernels of MMD, and asymptotic normality follows from properties of incomplete U-statistics. In finite sample cases, the correctness of this estimator is supported by the uniform p-value distribution in Figure 4(a), and also the fact that the false positive rate is successfully controlled at the desired \alpha in both synthetic and real datasets.

&gt;For instance, the proposed PSI estimator, we will need to estimate the covariance matrix. This was explained in Section 3.3, and it was said that the algorithm in Fan et al. (2013) was used for the explanation. However, I think more detailed discussions and explanation should be provided here. In order to obtain correct p-value estimate, I believe getting accurate covariance matrix estimate is crucial. How large the sample size is needed, in order for us to get an accurate enough covariance matrix, to perform sub-sequent post selection inference?

For hypothesis testing, the consistency of the covariance matrix estimator is necessary to get accurate covariance matrix estimates. In our PSI setup, the consistency of the covariance matrix estimator which corresponds to the result of Theorem 2 and its corollaries is derived under standard regularity conditions. 

In practice, for the small number of samples, the estimation of covariance matrix is extremely hard. As shown in the Figure 6 of supplementary material, we experimentally found that the estimation error of the incomplete MMD covariance is smaller than that of the block MMD covariance. Moreover, for the incomplete U-statistics MMD, we have $\ell=rn$ samples to estimate the covariance matrix, while we have only $n/B$ samples for the block MMD. That is, the number of samples that can be used for covariance estimation of the incomplete U-statistics estimator is $rB$ times larger than that of the block estimator. In the setup of Figure 6, we have $rB = 100$. For example, for $n = 1000$, we can use $5000$ samples for the incomplete U-statistics, while we have only $50$ samples for the block estimator. Thus, for the block MMD, this is problematic for high-dimensional case (e.g., d = 100), and the estimated covariance matrix is not full-rank. To alleviate this issue, we employ the POET algorithm for the block estimator.  

Moreover, we run the PSI algorithms for the white wine dataset by changing the number of samples as 200, 400, …, 4000. As can be seen, both PSI algorithms can control the FPR with 2000 samples. Moreover, it is clear that the incomplete U-statistics estimator can get better performance than the block estimator in both TPR and FPR.  We included this experimental result in the revised supplementary material (see Figure 8).</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HkgHB2j23X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>develop post feature selection inference for incomplete mmd</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkG5SjR5YQ&amp;noteId=HkgHB2j23X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper111 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper111 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper propose a method for post feature selection inference in the case where the distribution is non-Gaussian. The paper developed a statistic called incomplete mmd and showed its asymptotic normal property. Then the incomplete mmd can be plugged into post feature selection framework for computing the p-value. 

The paper is a nice combination of incomplete mmd and post selection inference technique. 
However, the combination is straightforward: the asymptotic Gaussian property of the incomplete mmd is the key. 

Furthermore, I think the applications (feature selection and test for GAN objective) is not exciting from the machine learning point of view.

However, the combination is straightforward: the asymptotic Gaussian property of the incomplete mmd is the key.

We would like to emphasize that, as far as we know this is the first selective inference method for distribution comparison (or two-sample test). To achieve this, combining MMD and PSI is one of the simple approaches. To deal with the normality constraint in PSI, we also proposed an incomplete U-statistics estimator for MMD and showed basic theoretical properties of the estimator. Although the combination itself is intuitive, since MMD is heavily used in machine learning community in two-sample testing and generative modeling, we believe that this new estimator and application to PSI can shed new light to further improvements of MMD-based algorithms.

&gt;Furthermore, I think the applications (feature selection and test for GAN objective) is not exciting from the machine learning point of view. A better application which can show-case the obtained p-value is very useful will make the paper more interesting.

Feature selection (or variable selection) is one of important machine learning problems including sparse learning. For instance, Lasso is a widely known feature selection method and there exist a large number of related papers in top machine learning venues. Even among the ICLR submissions this year, we found an another interesting feature selection paper:
KnockoffGAN: Generating Knockoffs for Feature Selection using Generative Adversarial Networks
<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByeZ5jC5YQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByeZ5jC5YQ</a> 

Moreover, feature selection has a number of important applications in biology and healthcare. In these filed, estimating p-value is extremely important. As for comparing generative models, analyzing GAN is one of hot topics in machine learning in particular for deep learning communities; although the result that we get (all null hypotheses rejected) is not the most surprising, we believe that the problem itself is important and further study needed.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SyghNyEchQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>clearly written, nice work</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkG5SjR5YQ&amp;noteId=SyghNyEchQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper111 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper111 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors focus on the selection problem of k statistically significant features discriminating 2 probability distributions accessible via samples. They propose a non-parametric approach under the PSI (post selection inference) umbrella using MMD (maximum mean discrepancy) as a discrepancy measure between probability distributions. The idea is to apply (asymptotically) normal MMD estimators, rephrase the top-k selection problem as a linear constraint, and reduce the problem to Lee et al., 2016. The efficiency of the approach is illustrated on toy examples and in GAN (generative adversarial network) context. The technique complements the PSI-based independence testing approach recently proposed by Yamada et al., 2018. 

The submission is a well-organized, clearly written, nice contribution; it can be relevant to the machine learning community.

Below I enlist a few suggestions to improve the manuscript:
-Section 1: The notion of characteristic kernel (kernel when MMD is metric) has not been defined, but it was referred to. 'Due to the mean embeddings in RKHS, all moment information is stored.': This sentence is somewhat vague.
-Section 1: 'MMD can be computed in closed form'. This is rarely the case (except for e.g. Gaussian distributions with Gaussian or polynomial kernels). I assume that the authors wanted refer to the estimation of MMD.
-Section 1: 'K nearest neighbor approaches (Poczos &amp; Schneider, 2011)'. The citation to this specific estimator can go under alpha-divergences. The Wasserstein metric could also be mentioned.
-Section 3.1: k is used to denote the number of selected features and also the kernel used in MMD. I suggest using different notations.
-Theorem 1: '\Phi is the CDF...'. There is no \Phi in the theorem.
-Section 3.2: The existence of MMD (mean embedding) requires certain assumptions: E_{x\sim p}\sqrt{k(x,x)} &lt; \infty, E_{x\sim q}\sqrt{k(x,x)} &lt; \infty.
-Section 3.2.: block estimator: 'B_1 and B_2 are finite'. 'fixed'?
-Section 3.2.: MMD_{inc}: 
   i) 'S_{n,k}': k looks superfluous.
   ii) 'l': it has not been introduced (cardinality of D).
-Section 3.3: typo: 'covraiance' (2x)
-Section 3.3: Fan et al. 2013: The citation can go to \citep{}.  
-Theorem 2: 
   i)'c' is left undefined.
   ii)Comma is missing before 'where'.
   iii)\xrightarrow{d} (Theorem 2, Corollary 3-4): Given that 'd' also denotes dimension in the submission, I suggest using a different notation for convergence in distribution.
-At the introduction of block-MMD the block size (B) was fixed, while in the experiments (e.g. Figure 3) it is growing with the sample size (B=\sqrt{n}). The assumption on B should be clearly stated.
-Section 5.1: (b) mean shift: comma is missing before 'where'.
-References: 
   i) Abbreviations and names in the titles should be capitalized (such as cramer, wasserstein, hilbert-schmidt, gan, nash). 
   ii) Scholkopf should be Sch\{"o}lkopf (in the ALT 2005 work).
   iii) 'Exact post-selection inference, with application to the lasso': All the authors are listed; 'et al.' is not needed.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1lGXvh8T7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Updated paper based on your review</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkG5SjR5YQ&amp;noteId=S1lGXvh8T7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper111 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">12 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper111 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">We really appreciate the thoughtful and detailed comments. 
We have corrected the grammatical errors and modified the manuscript based on the suggestions above.
Specifically, in Section 1, we modified the discerption of MMD; in section 2 we added more information on divergence measures. In section 4 and the supplementary material, we defined constant $c$ as the degeneracy of the U-stats kernel. And for the block estimate, we clarified that the block size is selected to be $\sqrt{n}$ in all our experiments.
