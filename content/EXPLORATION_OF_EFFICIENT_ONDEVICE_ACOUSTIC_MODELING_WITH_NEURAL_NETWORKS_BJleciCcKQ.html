Acoustic modeling is the fundamental part of speech recognition and is usually implemented with long short-term memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, the single thread execution of an LSTM RNN is extremely slow in most embedded devices because the algorithm needs to fetch a large number of parameters from the DRAM for computing each output sample. We explore a few acoustic modeling algorithms that can be executed very efficiently on embedded devices. These algorithms reduce the overhead of memory accesses using multi-timestep parallelization that computes multiple output samples at a time by reading the parameters only once from the DRAM. The algorithms considered are the quasi RNNs (QRNNs), Gated ConvNets, and diagonalized LSTMs. In addition, we explore neural networks that equip one-dimensional (1-D) convolution at each layer of these algorithms, and by which can obtain a very large performance increase in the QRNNs and Gated ConvNets. The experiments were conducted using two tasks, one is the connectionist temporal classification (CTC)-based end-to-end speech recognition on WSJ corpus and the other is the phoneme classification on TIMIT dataset. We not only significantly increase the execution speed but also obtain a much higher accuracy, compared to LSTM RNN-based modeling. Thus, this work can be applicable not only to embedded system-based implementations but also to server-based ones.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Parallelization, Speech Recognition, Sequence Modeling, Recurrent Neural Network, Embedded Systems</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Multi-timestep parallelizable acoustic modeling with diagonal LSTM, QRNN and Gated ConvNet</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJexv4Djn7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Review of "EXPLORATION OF EFFICIENT ON-DEVICE ACOUSTIC MODELING WITH NEURAL NETWORKS"</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJleciCcKQ&amp;noteId=BJexv4Djn7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper503 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">04 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper503 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper discusses applications of variants of RNNs and Gated CNN to acoustic modeling in embedded speech recognition systems, and the main focus of the paper is computational (memory) efficiency when we deploy the system. The paper well describes the problem of the current LSTM, especially focusing on the recurrent connection matrix operations, which is a bottle neck in this scenario, and introduces variants of RNNs (e.g., QRNN). Also these variants may not yield enough performance compared with LSTM, but 1-D convolution and/or deep structure helps to avoid the degradation. One of the biggest issues of this paper is that they use CTC as an acoustic model, while still many real speech recognition applications and major open source (Kaldi) use hybrid HMM/DNN(TDNN, LSTM, CNN, etc.) systems. Therefore, the paper's claim on CTC is not along with the current application trends. (It may be changed near future, but still hybrid systems are dominant). For example, the WSJ WER performance listed in Table 3 is easily obtained by a simple feed-forward DNN in the hybrid system. The latest Lattice free MMI with TDNN can achieve better performance (~2.X% WER), and this decoding is quite fast compared with LSTM. The authors should consider this current situation of state-of-the-art speech recognition. Also, the techniques described in the paper are all based on existing techniques, and the paper lacks the technical novelty.

Other comments:
- in Abstract and the first part of Introduction: as I mentioned above, CTC based character-prediction modeling is not a major acoustic model.
- The paper needs some discussions about TDNN, which is a major acoustic modeling (fast and accurate) in Kaldi
- p.4 first line "and  represents element-wise multiplication": The element-wise multiplication operation was first appeared in Eq. (1), and it should be explained there.
- Section 3.2: I actually don't fully understand the claims of this experiment based on TIMIT, as it is phoneme recognition, and not directly related to the real application, which is the main target of this paper I think. My suggestion is to place these TIMIT based experiments as a preliminary experiment to investigate the variants of RNN or gated CNN before the WSJ experiments. (I did not say that Section 3.2 is useless. This analysis is actually valuable, and this suggested change about the position of this TIMIT experiment can avoid some confusion of the main target of this paper.)

Four approaches are presented and evaluated: diag LSTM, QRNN, Gated ConvNet and adding a 1D convolution layer. The evaluation is done on ASR task using WSJ and in phoneme classification task using the TIMIT corpus. The study show that the inference speed is improved with comparable of better performance than the standard LSTM model.

The findings presented in this paper are interesting and quite useful when one wants to implement a LSTM-based acoustic model on mobile devices. The paper is well written and easy to ready. 

The main issue of this paper is the lack of novelty: the three evaluated approaches (Diag LSTM, QRNN and Gated ConvNet) are not novel, the only novelty is the addition of a 1D convolution, which is not enough for a conference like ICLR. 

Minor comments on the experiments:
* The network quantization approach has been shown to lead to efficient neural networks, could the authors provide a comparison between their approach and the quantization approach ?
* On the TIMIT experiment, the authors could add a decoder and use the PER metric instead of the frame accuracy, so they could provide comparison with the literature. 
* WSJ and TIMIT are quite small corpora compared to the available corpora, maybe the authors should consider using large corpora like Librispeech. It could be interesting to see the performance of the presented approaches.

Overall, this paper feels more like a technical report: the findings could be useful, but its novelty is too limited for ICLR. Hence I argue for rejection, and suggest that the authors consider submitting the paper to a speech conference like ICASSP.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HklSyeodh7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>review of the paper</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJleciCcKQ&amp;noteId=HklSyeodh7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper503 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper503 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper investigates a number of techniques and neural network architectures for embedded acoustic modeling.  The goal is to reduce the memory access and make efficient computation, in the meantime, to sustain good ASR performance.  Overall, the paper is well motivated and well written.  However, I have following concerns.

1. It is not clear from the paper whether both the training and inference are conducted on embedded devices or only the inference?  I assume it is the latter but can't find it explicitly mentioned in the paper.  

2. The exploration carried out in the paper is more on the system level and the novelty is not overwhelmingly significant.

3. My major concern is that the reported WERs on WSJ and phoneme classification accuracy are quite off.  20%-30% WERs for WSJ  do not seem to be usable in real applications.  Honestly, I don't even think this performance is better than well-trained GMM-HMM acoustic models using a Viterbi decoder.  Furthermore, there is no clear winners across the investigated architectures  in terms of performance.  One question is if one wants to deploy such an on-device system, which architecture shall be chosen?  

4. A more general comment on the work explored  in the paper.  First of all, the on-device memory issue puts a heavy constraint on the capacity of acoustic models, which will significantly hurt the modeling capability for the DNN-based acoustic models.  Deep learning acoustic models can outperform GMM-HMM because they can use large model capacity with very deep and complex architectures when a large amount of training data is available.  Second, for CTC, when the training data is limited,  its performance is far worse than the hybrid DNN-HMM model, let alone a pure end-to-end fashion without using external LM and dictionary.  If WFST-based decoders (composition of WFSTs of LM, dictionary and deblank/repetition) are used, then the memory issue will surface again.
