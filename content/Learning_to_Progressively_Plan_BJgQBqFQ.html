Their proposed method applies existing DAG-LSTM/Tree-LSTM architectures to iteratively refine local sections in the existing plan that could be improved until convergence. These models are then evaluated on a simulated job scheduling dataset and Halide expression simplification.

While this paper presents an interesting approach to the above two problems, its presentation and overall contribution was pretty unclear to me. A few points:

1. Ambiguous model setup: It may have been more advantageous to cut a large portion of Section 3 (Problem Setup), where the authors provide an extensive definition of an optimization problem, in favor of providing more critical details about the model setup. For example, how exactly should we view the job scheduling problem from an RL perspective? How are the state transitions characterized, how is the network actually trained (REINFORCE? something else?), is it episodic (if so, what constitutes an episode?), what is the exploration strategy, etc. It was hard for me to contextualize what exactly was going on

2. Weak experimental section: The authors mention that they compare their Neural Rewriter against DeepRM using a simplified problem setup from the original baseline. I wonder how their method would have fared against a task that was comparable in difficulty to the original method -- this doesn’t feel like a fair comparison. And although their expression simplification results were nice, I would also like to know why the authors chose to evaluate their method on the Halide repository specifically. Since they do not compare their method against any other baselines, it’s hard for me to gauge the significance of their results.

3. Variance across initializations: It would have been nice to see an experiment on how various initializations of schedules/expressions affect the policies learned. I would imagine that poor initializations could lead to poor results, but it would be interesting if the Neural Rewriter was robust to the quality of the initial policy. Since this is not addressed in the paper, it is difficult to gauge whether the authors’ model performed well due to an unfair advantage. Additionally, how much computational overhead is there to providing these (reasonable) initial policies as opposed to learning from scratch?

4. Unclear notation: As previously addressed by other reviewers, key definitions such as the predicted score SP(.) are missing from the text.

Summary:
Search-based policies are stronger than a reactive policies, but the resulting time consumption can be exponential. Existing solutions include designing a plan from scratch given a complete problem specification or performing iterative rewriting of the plan, though the latter approach has only been explored in problems where the action and state spaces are continuous.

In this work, the authors propose a novel study into the application of iterative rewriting planning schemes in discrete spaces and evaluate their approach on two tasks: job scheduling and expression simplification. They formulate the rewriting task as a reinforcement learning problem where the action space is the application of a set of possible rewriting rules to modify the discrete state. 

The approach is broken down into two steps. In the first step, a particular partition of the discrete state space is selected as needing to be changed by a score predictor. Following this step, a rule selector chooses which action to perform to modify this state space accordingly.

In the job scheduling task, the partition of the state space corresponds to a single job who’s scheduled time must be changed. the application of a rule to rewrite the state involves switching the order of any two jobs to be run. In the expression simplification task, a state to be rewritten corresponds to a subtree in the expression parse tree that can be converted to another expression.

To train, the authors define a mixed loss with two component:
1. A mean squared error term for training the score predictor that minimizes the difference between the benefit of the executed action and the predicted score given to that node
2. An advantage actor critic method for training the rule selector that uses the difference between the benefit of the executed action and the predicted score given to that node as a reward to evaluate the action sampled from the rule set

Pros:

-The approach seems to be relatively novel and the authors address an important problem.
-The authors don’t make their approach more complicated than it needs to be

Cons:

Notation: The notation could be a lot clearer. The variable names used in the tasks should be directly mapped to those defined in the theory in Section 2. It wasn’t clear that the state s_t in the job scheduling problem was defined as the set of all nodes g_j and their edges and that the {\hat g_t} corresponds to a single node. Also, there are some key details that have been relegated to the appendix that should be in the main body of the paper (e.g., how inference was performed)

Evaluation: The authors perform this evaluation on two automatically generated synthetic datasets. It’s not clear that the method would generalize to real data. Why not try the approach on a task such as grammar error correction? Additionally, I would have liked to see more analysis of the method. Apart from showing the comparison of the method with several baselines, the authors don’t provide many insights into how their method works. How data hungry is the method? Seeing as the data is synthetically generated, how effective would the method be with 10X of the training data, or 10% of it? Were any other loss functions attempted for training the model, or did the authors only try the Advantage Actor Critic? What about a self-critical approach? I'd like to see more analysis of how varying different components of the method such as the rule selector and score predictor affect performance.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SJeXthVBa7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Response and revision plan</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJgQB20qFQ&amp;noteId=SJeXthVBa7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1526 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">11 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1526 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thank you for your review and suggestions!

About your comments:

- “However, when starting with an initial solution there is always the danger of the final solution being overly biased by the initial solution.”

The motivation of our approach is to improve from existing solutions, and we agree that the rewriting process varies with different initial solutions, e.g., a nearly optimal solution would require a much fewer rewriting steps. However, we note that the quality of the final solution does not heavily depend on the initial one. In fact, we did experiments on job scheduling tasks with random initial schedules, and we found that the neural rewriter model achieves similar performance to the results starting with the earliest job first schedules, as reported in the paper (Section 5.1 on page 7). This demonstrates that our rewriting model is not overly biased by the initial solution. We will perform an ablation study about this point in our revision.

- “Since they are simply using previously proposed LSTM variants, I do not see much contribution here.”

We do not claim that each individual component of our model is novel; instead, our key contribution is the overall framework (Fig. 1) that learns a neural network to progressively improve existing planning in the discrete space, and training the framework with reinforcement learning.

- “More importantly, details are missing such as the definitions of SP and RS from section 4.4.”

These definitions are in Section 4.1 (page 4).
