We formulate the problem of model uncertainty as a continuous Bayes-Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BAMDP), where an agent maintains a posterior distribution over the latent model parameters given a history of observations and maximizes its expected long-term reward with respect to this belief distribution. Our algorithm, Bayesian Policy Optimization, builds on recent policy optimization algorithms to learn a universal policy that navigates the exploration-exploitation trade-off to maximize the Bayesian value function. To address challenges from discretizing the continuous latent parameter space, we propose a policy network architecture that independently encodes the belief distribution from the observable state. Our method significantly outperforms algorithms that address model uncertainty without explicitly reasoning about belief distributions, and is competitive with state-of-the-art Partially Observable Markov Decision Process solvers.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Bayes-Adaptive Markov Decision Process, Model Uncertainty, Bayes Policy Optimization</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We formulate model uncertainty in Reinforcement Learning as a continuous Bayes-Adaptive Markov Decision Process and present a method for practical and scalable Bayesian policy optimization.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rkgKO-c637" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Review</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGvns0qK7&amp;noteId=rkgKO-c637"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper720 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper720 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">In this paper, the author proposed to utilize a novel policy structure and recent batch policy optimization methods such as PPO or TRPO to solve Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP) and Partial Observable MDP(POMDP) problems. The author verified the proposed method on discrete and continuous POMDP and BAMDP benchmarks compared with other baseline methods.  

The main part of the paper is trying to explain Bayesian RL and the relationship between BAMDP and POMDP, and several related work. There is only a half page that explains the main idea of the proposed method, and it seems that the author combines several existing techniques and utilize deep learning to solve BAMDP and POMDP problems.

The detail of the experiment is not clarified explicitly, such as the structure and size of the policy, training details of the BPO, and detail parameters changed to formulate BAMDP for Mujoco environments.

The paper strikes me as a valuable contribution once the detail of the experiments are addressed, but personally I am not sure that whether the novelty of this paper is enough for the main conference track.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Hklm9vec3m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Experiment results are not much convincing.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGvns0qK7&amp;noteId=Hklm9vec3m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper720 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper720 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary: This paper proposes a policy optimization framework for Bayesian RL (BPO). BPO is based on a Bayesian model-based RL formulation. Using a Bayesian approach, it is expected to have better trade-off between exploration and exploitation in RL, and be able to deal with model uncertainty as well. Experiments are done on multiple domains consisting both POMDP planning tasks and RL.

In general, the paper is well written. Related work are thoroughly discussed. In my opinion, the proposed idea is a solid combination of existing techniques: Monte-Carlo sampling (step 3), Bayes belief update, and policy gradient in POMDP (G(PO)MDP). However, this combination is still worth trying and has been shown to scale to larger problems through the use of deep learning.

I have some following major concerns about the paper:

- Root sampling (step 3 in Algorithm 1) would result in sampled models that are fixed in every simulation. In a pure nature of Bayes RL, after each update at new observation (step 11: belief update), the model distribution already changes. Thus how does this Algorithm can guarantee an optimal solution for BAMDP? can the authors have more discussions on this point? Does this explain why TRPO (using a mean model) can perform comparably to BPO in Ant? 

- Belief representation is based on a Bayes filter which requires discretization. Finely discretized belief would increase the complexity and computation dramatically with the dimension of the latent space. This would result in very slow SIMULATE steps, especially for a long-horizon problem, let alone further computation for BatchPolicyOptimization.

- I wonder how TRPO using RNN would perform in this case, instead of using a wrong starting model (an average model)?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_ryg0dfCYnX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Solid</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGvns0qK7&amp;noteId=ryg0dfCYnX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper720 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper720 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Evaluation:
This is a solid paper: The idea is clear, it is well communicated and put into context of the existing literature, and the results are promising. The experiments are well chosen and illustrate the method well. The connection between the chosen setting (BAMDPs) to POMDPs is explained well and explored in the empirical evaluation as well. I think that the methods section could go into a bit more detail, and the underlying assumptions that the authors make could be discussed more critically.

Summary:
This paper looks at Bayes-Adaptive MDPs (BAMDPs) in which the latent parameter space is either
- a discrete finite set or
- a bounded continuous set that can be approximated via discretization.
Consequently, the authors choose to represent the belief as a categorical distribution, which can be represented by a vector of weights.
They further assume that the environment model is known. Hence, the posterior belief can be computed exactly.
If I understand correctly, the main contribution is that the authors represent the policy as a neural network and train it using a policy gradient algorithm.
This is a good first step towards scalable Bayesian policy optimisation.

Main Feedback:
- In the Introduction, first paragraph, you say one of the aspects of real-world robotics is that there's "(1) an underlying dynamical system with unknown latent parameters". I would argue that the dynamic system itself is typically also unknown, including how it is parametrized by these latent parameters. I think it is important to point this out more explicitly in the introduction (it is mentioned in sec 2 and 5, but maybe it's worth mentioning it in 4 again as well): for the problems that you look at, you assume that the form of the transition function is known (just not its parameters phi). 
- In the main methods section (4), it would be nice to see some more detail about the Bayes filter. Can you write out the distribution over the latent parameters, and write out how the filtering is done? Explain how to compute the normalising constant (and mention explicitly why this is possible for your set-up, and why it would be infeasible if the latent space cannot be discretized). How exactly is the posterior distribution represented and fed to the policy? Seeing this done explicitly in Section 4 (even if it repeats some things that are explained in 2) would help someone that is interested in (re-)implementing the proposed method.
- I would like to see a more critical discussion in Section 7 about the assumptions that the authors make: that the environment models are known, and that the latent space can be discretized. How realistic are those assumptions (and in which kind of real-world problems can we make them), and what are ways forward to drop these assumptions?

Other Comments:
- Introduction: Using an encoder for the state/belief is an implementation choice, and (as I see it) not part of the main contribution. I would focus on explaining the intuition behind BPO in the introduction, and only mention the architecture choice as a side note.
- Related Work: The authors might be interested in the recent work of Igl et al. (ICML 2018, "Deep Variational RL for POMDPs"), who approximate the belief in a POMDP using variational inference and a particle filter.

Significance for ICLR:
- In the light-dark experiment, the authors visualise the belief that the agent has at every time step. It would have been nice to see an analysis of how exactly the belief looks also for maybe 1-2 other experiments, and how (when) the agent makes a decision based on this. This could replace Table 2 (which I guess should be called Figure 2?), which I did not find very insightful.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
