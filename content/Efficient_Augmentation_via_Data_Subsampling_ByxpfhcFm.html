However, this process is often performed in an inefficient manner, as artificial examples are created by applying a number of transformations to all points in the training set. The resulting explosion of the dataset size can be an issue in terms of storage and training costs, as well as in selecting and tuning the optimal set of transformations to apply. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to significantly reduce the number of data points included in data augmentation while realizing the same accuracy and invariance benefits of augmenting the entire dataset. We propose a novel set of subsampling policies, based on model influence and loss, that can achieve a 90% reduction in augmentation set size while maintaining the accuracy gains of standard data augmentation.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">data augmentation, invariance, subsampling, influence</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Selectively augmenting difficult to classify points results in efficient training.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HylD3z4ch7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Incomprehensive experiments with several missing baselines</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byxpfh0cFm&amp;noteId=HylD3z4ch7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1306 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1306 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary: The authors study the problem of identifying subsampling strategies for data augmentation, primarily for encoding invariances in learning methods. The problem seems relevant with applications to learning invariances as well as close connections with the covariate shift problem. 

Contributions: The key contributions include the proposal of strategies based on model influence and loss as well as empirical benchmarking of the proposed methods on vision datasets. 

Clarity: While the paper is written well and is easily accessible, the plots and the numbers in the tables were a bit small and thereby hard to read. I would suggest the authors to have bigger plots and tables in future revisions to ensure readability. 

&gt;&gt; The authors mention in Section 4.1 that "support vector are points with non-zero loss": In all generality, this statement seems to be incorrect. For example, even for linearly separable data, a linear SVM would have support vectors which are correctly classified. 

&gt;&gt; The experiment section seems to be missing a table on the statistics of the datasets used: This is important to understand the class distribution in the datasets used and if at all there was label imbalance in any of them. It looks like all the datasets used for experimentation had almost balanced class labels and in order to fully understand the scope of these sampling strategies, I would suggest the authors to also provide results on class imbalanced datasets where the distribution over labels is non-uniform. 

&gt;&gt; Incomprehensive comparison with benchmarks: 
a) The comparison of their methods with VSV benchmark seems incomplete. While the authors used the obtained support vectors as the augmentation set and argued that it is of fixed size, a natural way to extend these to any support size is to instead use margin based sampling where the margins are obtained from the trained SVM since these are inherently margin maximizing classifiers. Low margin points are likely to be more influential than high margin points.
b) In Section 5.3, a key takeaway is "diversity and removing redundancy is key in learning invariances". This leads to possibly other benchmarks to which the proposed policies could be compared, for example those based on Determinantal point processes (DPP) which are known for inducing diversity in subset selection. There is a large literature on sampling diverse subsets (based on submodular notions of diversity) which seems to be missing from comparisons. Another possible way to overcome this would be to use stratified sampling to promote equal representation amongst all classes. 
c) In Section 2, it is mentioned that general methods for dataset reduction are orthogonal to the class of methods considered in this paper. However, on looking at the data augmentation problem as that of using fewest samples possible to learn a new invariance, it can be reduced to a dataset reduction problem. One way of using these reduction methods is to use the selected set of datapoints as the augmentation set and compare their performance. This would provide another set of benchmarks to which proposed methods should be compared.

&gt;&gt; Accuracy Metrics: While the authors look at the overall accuracy of the learnt classifiers, in order to understand the efficacy of the proposed sampling methods at learning invariances, it would be helpful to see the performance numbers separately on the original dataset as well as the transformed dataset using the various transformations. 

&gt;&gt; Experiments in other domains: The proposed schemes seem to be general enough to be applicable to domains other than computer vision. Since the focus of the paper is the proposal of general sampling strategies, it would be good to compare them to baselines on other domains possibly text datasets or audio datasets. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Hkldxs7qnX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Intuitive and useful</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byxpfh0cFm&amp;noteId=Hkldxs7qnX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1306 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1306 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Data augmentation is a useful technique, but can lead to undesirably large data sets. The authors propose to use influence or loss-based methods to select a small subset of points to use in augmenting data sets for training models where the loss is additive over data points, and investigate the performance of their schemes when logistic loss is used over CNN features. Specifically, they propose selecting which data points to augment by either choosing points where the training loss is high, or where the statistical influence score is high (as defined in Koh and Liang 2017). The cost of their method is that of fitting an initial model on the training set, then fitting the final model on the augmented data set.

They compare to reasonable baselines: no augmentation, augmentation by transforming only a uniformly random chosen portion of the training data, and full training data augmentation; and show that augmenting even 10% of the data with their schemes can give loss competitive with full data augmentation, and lower than the loss achievable with no augmentation or augmentation of a uniformly random chosen portion of the data of similar size. Experiments were done on MNIST, CIFAR, and NORB.

The paper is clearly written, the idea is intuitively attractive, and the experiments give convincing evidence that the method is practically useful. I believe it will be of interest to a large portion of the ICLR community, given the usefulness of data augmentation.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SyxMijTQhX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Useful idea, though the contribution is a bit marginal</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byxpfh0cFm&amp;noteId=SyxMijTQhX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1306 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">29 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1306 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper considers how to augment training data by applying class-preserving transformations to selected datapoints.
It proposes improving random datapoint selection by selection policies based on two metrics: the training loss 
associate with each datapoint ("Loss"), and the influence score (from Koh and Liang that approximates leave-one-one test loss). The authors consider two policies based on these metrics: apply transformations to training points in decreasing 
order of their score, or to training points sampled with probability proportional to score. They also consider two 
refinements: downweighting observations that are selected for transformation, and updating scores everytime 
transformations associated with an observation are added. 

The problem the authors tackle is important and their approach is natural and promising. On the downside, the theoretical 
contribution is moderate, and the empirical studies quite limited. 

The stated goals of the paper are quite modest: "In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to significantly reduce the 
number of data points included in data augmentation while realizing the same accuracy and invariance benefits of 
augmenting the entire dataset". It is not too surprising that carefully choosing observations according suitable policies 
is an improvement over random subsampling, especially, when the test data has been "poisoned" to highlight this effect. 
The authors have demonstrated that two intuitive policies do indeed work, have quantified this on 3 datasets. 

However they do not address the important question of whether doing so can improve training time/efficiency. In other words, the authors have not attempted to investigate the computational cost of trying to assign importance scores to each observation. Thus this paper does not really demonstrate the overall usefulness of the proposed methodology.

The experimental setup is also limited to (I think) favor the proposed methodology. Features are precomputed on images using a CNN, and the different methods are compared on a logistic regression layer acting on the frozen features. The existence of such a pretrained model is necessary for the proposed methods, otherwise one cannot assign selection scores to different datapoints. However, this is not needed for random selection, where the transformed inputs can directly be input to the system. A not unreasonable baseline would be to train the entire CNN with the augmented 5%,10%, 25% datasets, rather than just the last layer. Of course this now involves training the entire CNN on the augmented dataset, rather than just the last layer, but how relevant is the two stage training approach that the authors propose?

In short, while I think the proposed methodology is promising, the authors missed a chance to include a more thorough analysis of the trade-offs of their method.

I also think the paper makes only a minimal effort to understand the policies, the experiments could have helped shed some more light on this.

Minor point:
The definition of "influence" is terse e.g. I do not see the definition of H anywhere (the Hessian of the empirical loss)</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
