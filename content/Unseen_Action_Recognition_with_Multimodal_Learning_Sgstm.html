The paper aims to learn a common embedding space for video appearance and text caption features. The learned shared embedding space then allows multiple applications of zero-shot activity classification, unsupervised activity discovery and unseen activity captioning.

The method is based on two autoencoders which have a common intermediate space. The losses optimized encourage the standard unimodal reconstructions in the AEs, along with joint embedding distances (appearance and text of the same video are encoded close by) as well as cross domain mapping (video encoding generates text and vice-versa), and cycle consistency. Apart from these additional supervised losses, unsupervised losses are added with adversarial learning which aim to bring the video and text encoding distributions in the common space close, as well as the standard real and generated video/text distributions close by adding corresponding discriminators (like in GANs). The whole system is learned end-to-end in two phases, first with supervised paired data and then with all paired and unpaired data.

The experiments are shown on four datasets: ActivityNet, HMDB, UCF101, MLB-YouTube

Positives:	
- The problem of multimodal learning is an interesting and challenging problem
- The paper is novel; while the idea of a joint shared embedding space is not new this paper adds new losses as summarized above and shows reasonably convincing empirical results
- The results are shown for diverse applications which highlight the generality of the method
- The use of unpaired/unsupervised data is also relatively less explored which this paper incorporates as well
- The empirical results given are convincing, eg Tab1 gives a good ablation study showing how the different components affect the performance. SoA comparison are given on a standard task (however see below)

Negatives:
- Comparison with state of the art result Tab2 should also contain the features used. The performances might just be higher due to the better features used (Kinetics pretrained I3D). Please give a self implemented baseline method with same features but some standard loss in the shared space to give an idea of the strength of the features.
- Ideally features provided by previous papers’ authors should be used if available and it should be shown that the proposed method improves results.

Overall the paper is well written and had novel aspects which are convincingly evaluated on challenging and diverse tasks.

The approach was tested on a collection of datasets including a newly introduced dataset, with the embedding and evaluated on three tasks: zero-shot classification, activity clustering and captioning.

The paper is easy to read in general and the approach is scientifically sound. The need for an autoencoder in multimodal embedding has been proven for a variety of modalities including image-text, video-text, image-audio and video-audio. The contribution here is thus focused on temporal pooling through a learnt attention layer.

However, the paper has a mix of tasks (3 tasks tested), without a conclusive understanding of the effect of the various loss functions on the learnt space. As the importance of various losses changes per task and dataset, the take-away message from the work is not obvious. Additionally, using unpaired data, proposed through a large-scale dataset is not obvious. The paper concludes that related data is required but how related data can be collected remains unexplored.

The evaluation for the unsupervised discovery seems biased – 1NearestNeighbour is used as opposed to the more balanced mAP on ranking all test sequences as opposed to top-1. 

The collected dataset, which is a contribution of the paper is also poorly explained. The authors collect ‘dense annotations’ but it is not clear how many annotators were used, and what instructions they were given. The paper does not give examples of the collected annotations and how these differ from previous annotations available with the dataset (Fig 4).

Appendix 1 concludes with sentences proposed to annotate UCF. These seem to apply per action and it’s not clear how they scale to the different instances, e.g. Action Surfing (85) is assigned to a male caption ‘a man is’, action 100 to a woman and action 96 to groups of people ‘people are riding’. This distinction is not obvious in all the instances of the dataset and such captioning might have significantly biased the results.

Overall, there is little explanation of the decisions made to produce the comparative results. The novelty is limited to the attention pooling, which is not evaluated on all the three tasks. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rkgxy1Tr2m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>limited novelty and wrong experimental settings</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S14g5s09tm&amp;noteId=rkgxy1Tr2m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper506 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">30 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper506 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes a joint embedding model that aligns video sequences with sentences describing the context (caption) in a shared embedding space. With the space, various tasks such as zero-shot activity recognition and unseen video captioning can be performed. The problem tackled in this paper is interesting. However, the approach proposed is limited in novelty and there are some serious flaws in the experimental settings. So overall, this paper is not yet ready for publication. 

Pros:

•	The overall bidirectional encoder-decoder architecture for learning a shared embedding space is sensible. It is also interesting that adversarial training is introduced so that unlabelled data can be utilized. 
•	Additional annotations are provided to two activity recognition datasets, creating new benchmarks.
Cons
•	My first concern is the limited novelty of the work. Although I am not aware of a joint embedding learning model that has exactly the same architecture and formulation, the model is closely related to many existing ones both in zero-shot learning and beyond. More specifically,
o	The overall framework is similar to “correlational neural networks”, Neural Computation, 2016 by Chandar et al. This should be acknowledged.
o	The connections to CyclyGan and its variants for image-to-image style transfer is obvious, as pointed out by the authors.
o	More importantly, there are quite a few closely related zero-shot learning (ZSL) papers published recently. Although they focus on static images and class name, rather that image sequences and sentences, I don’t see any reason why these models cannot be applied to solve the same problem tackled in this paper. In particular, the autoencoder architecture was first used in ZSL in E. Kodirov, T. Xiang and S. Gong, "Semantic Autoencoder for Zero-Shot Learning", in IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Honolulu, Hawaii, July 2017. This work is further extended in Chen et al, “Zero-Shot Visual Recognition using Semantics-Preserving Adversarial Embedding Network”, cvpr18, now with adversarial learning. Similarly, variational autoencoder is adopted in Wang et al, Zero-Shot Learning via Class-Conditioned Deep Generative Models, AAAI 2018.  Note that the joint embedding spaces in these studies are the semantic spaces – attribute or word vector spaces representing the classes. In contrast, since the semantic modality is a variable-length word sequences, this is not possible, so a third space (other than the visual feature space or semantic space) is used as the embedding space. Beyond these autoencoder based models, there are also a number of recent ZSL works that use a conditional generative model with adversarial loss. Instead of learning a joint embedding space where the visual and text modalities are aligned and compared for recognition, these works use the text modality as condition to the generative model to synthesize visual features for the unseen classes followed by a conventional supervised classifier. The representative one of this line of work is Xian et al, “Feature Generating Networks for Zero-Shot Learning, cvpr18”.
o	In summary, there are too many existing works that are similar to the proposed one in one or more aspects. The authors failed to acknowledge most of them; moreover, it is not argued theoretically or demonstrated empirically, why combining different approaches together is necessary/making fundamental differences.

•	My second main concern is the experiment setting. This paper adopts a conventional ZSL setting in two aspects: (1) the visual features are obtained by a video CNN, I3D, which is pretrained on the large (400 or 600 classes depending on which version is used) Kinetics dataset. This dataset have classes overlapping with those in ActivityNet, HMDB and UCF101. So if these overlapped classes are used in the unseen class partition, then the ZSL assumption (the target classes are ‘unseen’) is violated. (2): The test data only contains unseen class samples. In practice, one will face a test set composed of a mix of seen and unseen classes. Under this more realistic setting (termed generalized ZSL in the ZSL community), a ZSL must avoid the bias towards the seen classes which provide the only visual data available during training. The two problems have been identified in the ZSl community when static images are considered. As a result, the conventional setting has been largely abandoned in the last two years and the ‘pure’ and ‘generalized’ settings become the norm; that is, there is no overlapping classes between the test classes and classes used to pretrain the visual feature extraction network; and both seen and unseen class samples are used for testing. The ZSL evaluation is only meaningful under this more rigorous and realistic setting. In summary, the experimental results presented in this paper are obtained under the wrong setting and the proposed model is not compared with a number of closely related ZSL models listed above, so it is not possible to judge how effective the proposed model is.
