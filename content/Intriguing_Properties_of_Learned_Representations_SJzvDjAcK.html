The very last layer of a neural network is then simply a linear model trained on these learned representations. Despite their numerous applications in other tasks such as classification, retrieval, clustering etc., a.k.a. transfer learning, not much work has been published that investigates the structure of these representations or indeed whether structure can be imposed on them during the training process.

In this paper, we study the effective dimensionality of the learned representations  by models that have proved highly successful for image classification.  We focus on ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and VGG-19 and  observe that when trained on CIFAR10 or CIFAR100, the learned representations exhibit a fairly low rank structure.  We propose a modification to the training procedure,  which further encourages low rank structure on learned activations.  Empirically, we show that this has implications for  robustness to adversarial examples  and compression.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">deep learning, low rank representations, adversarial robustness</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Imposing a low rank structure on learned representations in deep networks yields a lot of interesting benefits.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJlSboq02m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Too few experiments for many analyses</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzvDjAcK7&amp;noteId=rJlSboq02m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper271 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper271 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper presents a way to induce low-rank representations in a deep neural network and study its effect on adversarial attacks.

Quality

The analyses are conducted on several types of problems, first classification tasks for confirmation of the low-rank structure, and then on adversarial attacks. Unfortunately, there is only a very few number of experiments per analysis, making it virtually impossible to infer reliably any trends in the data. Table 1, 2, 3 and 4 contains at best enough information for a proof of concept, but it is not possible to make any conclusion out of them. Also, VGG results only appear in figure 2 where they appear to contradict the conclusions held by the authors. Is it difficult to understand why results from VGG do not appear in any table. 

Clarity

The paper is difficult to follow. Introduction gives too much details and even contains methodological information, all of which obfuscates the main message which does get more clear in the latter sections. The sections 2 and 3 are confusing because they do not follow the logic presented in the abstract. The latter states that observations on the low-rank structure of the representations will be done prior to experimentally impose low-rank. However, section 2 presents the low-rank structure imposed on models while section 3 presents the observations of low-rank-representations jointly with the results of imposed low-rank structure.

There is no clear definitions of what the "intriguing properties" are beside the fact that forced low-rank representations yield similar results on classification and are more robust to adversarial attacks on a very limited number of experiments.

Originality

Using low-rank representation is not something new and has already been explored in [1] for instance.

Significance

There would be an important contribution to make if the author would analyze the effect of low-rank by varying the constraint. However, the current analyses are not pushed far enough to get any useful insight using only a fixed rank and making a minor modification by adding one or two LR-layers. Experiments in table 2 is a good step in this direction nonetheless.

Overall, this paper was fairly well written and seems to have an original approach towards inducing low-rank structure on the space of activations in some intermediate layer in a computationally efficient way without changing the underlying model. This training modification does not seem to affect test performance and the low-rank embeddings that are learned seem useful at discriminative tasks. Adversarial robustness also appears improved.

Pros:
--While I am not familiar enough with the background literature on model compression in neural networks, I thought the augmented optimization problem used to induce low-rank structure on the space of activations was interesting and worthy of investigation. The authors appear to get great results in Table 1 &amp; Table 2.

Cons:
--I cannot really gauge the significance of the result against other existing approaches towards low-dimensional representations because of my limited familiarity with the relevant literature. However, I didnâ€™t feel quite convinced by the discussion in the paper that low-rank activations were superior to other kinds of low-rank approximations, for instance to the network weights (c.f. discussion in Appendix A). I think the discussion on this topic could be a bit improved.
--With respect to the writing, Iâ€™m a bit uncertain as to the primary message of the paper. While it seems to introduce a new augmented training approach for generating compressed representations which potentially has practical utility, based on the paper title and scattered discussion it seems to suggest that the representations themselves are interesting, e.g. the idea of having low-rank activations while largely maintaining test performance. I didnâ€™t fully understand the extent to which the results are intriguing or helpful in understanding neural networks. Could this be developed a bit more?

Miscellaneous comments:
--In Figure 2, the accuracy with respect to adversarial perturbations seems to drop more for VGG19 2-LR (pink curve) than the model VGG19 N-LR (brown), which seems counter to your point on robustness?
--In Figure 4, why is the behavior of ResNet 2-LR (blue curve) similar to ResNet N-LR (red curve)? I wouldâ€™ve expected any number of LR layers to increase the sensitivity in intermediate layers to adversarial input perturbations.

The authors motivates their work by saying that such representation are more useful for transfer learning and are more robust to adversarial examples! In order to achieve this, the authors introduce a virtual LR layer and utilize Nystrom technique to make the process more efficient.  The idea introduced in this paper is interesting but the paper is poorly written and organized which makes its through evaluation difficult. Below, I provide more detailed comments.

I don't understand at what frequency the low-rank optimization as the  subproblem to Equation (OPT) is being done. Given that the DNN training  is being done using batched of examples, where do you put the low-rank  optimization, in the end of each epoch? It seems it is in the end of each epoch but it should be clearly stated.

I don't understand motivation for L_N(A). The authors justify it by  saying that a trivial solution for the optimization problem would be setting A+b=0 and they introduce this term to avoid it. However, this is not correct. Note that there are n examples in A and we can only make one of them  zero at a time. (Note that talking about A+b is not also accurate  because they are not of the same size).

In order to use Nystrom method for low-rank approximation, W needs to be  a symmetric postive semi-definite matrix. I am not sure if the heuristic  procedure introduced in Page 4 is well-justifed. and whether we are  still optimizing the objective function introduced in Page 3. Do we  still have a stable training?

What is ResNet N-LR in experiment? The authors introduced ResNet 1-LR and ResNet 2-LR but not ResNet N-LR! I found the description N-LR later but the naming is rather confusing. I would use LR instead of N-LR because it seems it has N LR layer. I would also explain this next to other methods. 

Not sure if I understand Bottle-LR. The description in the text is not clear and I donâ€™t understand the motivation for this baseline! Again, this should be described next to other methods.

The authors do not mention what is their setting for r in the experiments (Table 1).

Page 5, Paragraph after Table 1: First CIFAR-100 should be CIFAR-10.

One way the authors defend their framework is to have a representation that can be used in transfer learning. Nonetheless, the results in Table 1.b shows that their framework is not doing good for transfer learning.

Not sure if I understand Figure 1. How do you change the number of singular values? I understand this is a hyper parameter for your framework but I am confused how it is being set for N-LR method. Similarly, I donâ€™t understand Table 2 and how you change the embedding dimension. 


Unlike the claim made by the authors, it seems that VGG19 N-LR does better compared to VGG19 2-LR in Figure 2. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
