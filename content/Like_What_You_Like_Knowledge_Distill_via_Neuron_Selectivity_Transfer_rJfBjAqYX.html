Consequently, the acceleration and compression of neural networks have attracted much attention recently. Knowledge Transfer (KT), which aims at training a smaller student network by transferring knowledge from a larger teacher model, is one of the popular solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge transfer method by treating it as a distribution matching problem. Particularly, we match the distributions of neuron selectivity patterns between teacher and student networks. To achieve this goal, we devise a new KT loss function by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric between these distributions. Combined with the original loss function, our method can significantly improve the performance of student networks. We validate the effectiveness of our method across several datasets, and further combine it with other KT methods to explore the best possible results. Last but not least, we fine-tune the model to other tasks such as object detection. The results are also encouraging, which confirm the transferability of the learned features.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Knowledge Distill</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We treat knowledge distill as a distribution matching problem and adopt Maximum Mean Discrepancy to minimize the distances between student features and teacher features.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">5 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BygynUFT3X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Need to improve clarity and interpretability</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJf0BjAqYX&amp;noteId=BygynUFT3X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper134 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper134 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This submission proposes a novel loss function, based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), for knowledge transfer (distillation) from a teacher network to a student network, which matches the spatial distribution of neuron activations between the two.

The proposed approach is interesting but there is significant room for improvement. In particular:

*Clarity*

It is not clear how the distribution of neuron activation are matched between the teach and student network. The C_T and C_S are not defined specifically enough. Does it include all layers? Or does it only include a specific layer (such as the last convolution layer)?

*Interpretability*

Section 4.1. tries to interpret the approach but it is still not clear why matching distribution is better. The MMD loss proposed could run into problem if the classification task does not involve "spatial variation". For example, for a extremely simple task of classifying three classes "R", "G" and "B" where the whole image has the same color of R, G and B respectively, the spatial distribution is uniform and the proposed MMD loss would be 0 even if the student network's channels do not learn discriminative feature maps. Another example is when a layer has H=W=1.

*Significance*

The experiment shows that polynomial-two kernel gives better result, but Sec. 4.3.2. mentions that it is equivalent to Li et al. (2017b) in this case.

*Practical usefulness not justified*

In the experimental section, the student network's number of parameters and FLOPS are not detailed, so it is unclear how much efficiency gain the proposed method achieved. Note in practice small networks such as MobileNet and ShuffleNet have achieved significantly better accuracy-efficiency trade-off than the teacher networks considered here (either for CIFAR10 or for ImageNet1k).

*Improvement not significant*

The results obtained by the proposed approach is not very significant compared to "KD" along.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rylOvP0FnX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Unclear presentation, results and novelty</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJf0BjAqYX&amp;noteId=rylOvP0FnX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper134 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper134 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper targets knowledge distillation of a large network to a smaller network. The approach is summarized by equations (3) and (4), which in short proposes that one should use the maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) of the network activations as a loss term for distillation.  

When considering CIFAR image classification tasks, it is shown that only when using a specific quadratic polynomial kernel (which as described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.01036.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.01036.pdf</a> is tantamount of applying neural style transfer) the proposed approach is able to match the performance of the seminal paper of Hinton et al.  When embarking to imagenet, the proposed approach is only able to match the performance of standard knowledge distillation by adding the quadratic term (texture in neural style synthesis jargon). This is actually a sensible proposal. Yet, the claims about MMD as a way of explaining neural style transfer has appeared in the paper cited above, which the authors mention.

The idea of transferring from one domain to another using MMD as a regularizer appeared in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06636.pdf by Long et al --- indeed equation (3) of this paper matches exactly equation (10) of Long et al. Note too that Long et al also discuss what kernels work well and which work poorly due to vanishing gradients and propose parametrised solutions. This is something this paper failed to do.

The two works cited above make me wonder about the novelty of the current paper.  In fact, this paper ends us being an application of the neural style transfer loss function to network distillation. As such this could be useful, if not already done by someone else previously.

I find that the paper is poorly written, with many typos, and lacks focus on a single concrete story. The CIFAR experiments fail to use KD+NST (ie the thing that works for imagenet - neural style transfer) and section 5.3 appears trivial in light of the cited works. For all these reasons, I am inclined to reject this paper.

The teacher and student models are matched using MMD objectives, the author demonstrates different variants of matching kernels specializes to previously proposed variants of knowledge distillation.

- The extensive evaluation suggests that the MMD with polynomial kernel provides better results than the previously proposed method.
-  It is interesting to see that MMD based transfer has more advantage on the object detection tasks.
- Can the author provides more insights into the behavior of different kernels, for example visualizing, the gradient map might help us to understand why certain kernel works better than another one?
- Did you consider translation invariance or other spatial properties when designing your kernels?

In summary, this is an interesting paper with good empirical results. The technique being used generalization is quite straightforward, but the paper also includes a good amount of discussion on why the proposed approach could be better and I think that really helps the reader.
