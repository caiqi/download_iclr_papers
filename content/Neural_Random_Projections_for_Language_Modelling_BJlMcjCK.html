By learning distributed vector representations for words, each training sample informs the neural network model about a combinatorial number of other patterns. In this paper, we exploit the sparsity in natural language even further by encoding each unique input word using a fixed sparse random representation. 
These sparse codes are then projected onto a smaller embedding space which allows for the encoding of word occurrences from a possibly unknown vocabulary, along with the creation of more compact language models using a reduced number of parameters. We investigate the properties of our encoding mechanism empirically, by evaluating its performance on the widely used Penn Treebank corpus. We show that guaranteeing approximately equidistant vector representations for unique discrete inputs is enough to provide the neural network model with enough information to learn --and make use-- of 
distributed representations for these inputs.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">neural networks, language modelling, natural language processing, uncertainty, random projections</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Neural language models can be trained with a compressed embedding space, by using sparse random projections, created incrementally for each unique discrete input.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BklvEZwc3m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Experiments and novelty need improvement</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJlMcjC5K7&amp;noteId=BklvEZwc3m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper515 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper515 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper presents some experiments using random projections instead of embeddings from a 1-of-V encoding.  Experiments on the Penn TreeBank benchmark data set show that in a feed-forward language modeling architecture similar to that of (Bengio, 2003), the random projections substantially reduce the number of parameters of the model while not harming perplexity too much.

The paper would need to be improved substantially in order to appear at a conference like ICLR.  First, the novelty of the approach is limited -- the approach amounts to using a sparse integer layer instead of a floating-point layer within a feed-forward architecture.

Second, and more importantly, the experiments need to be re-done to better measure the practical impact of the techniques.  First, larger data sets such as Wikitext-2 and Wikitext-103, and/or the billion-word benchmark, are needed to understand how well the approach works in practical LM settings.  Second, the paper needs to use more state-of-the-art architectures.  Language modeling is a fast-moving field, so the very latest and greatest techniques are not strictly necessary for this paper, but at least midsize LSTM models that get scores in the ~80 ppl range for Penn Treebank are important, otherwise it becomes very questionable whether the results will provide any practical impact in today's best models.  Finally, the paper needs to compare its parameter-reduction approaches against other compression and hyperparameter optimization techniques.  Changing the number/sizes of the network layers or using sparse weight matrices (perhaps with sparsity-inducing regularization) would be natural ways to reduce the parameter space.

In my opinion, due to how many researchers are and have been looking into improvements of language modeling, the authors may find it hard to break new ground in this direction.

Minor
In the start of Section 3, it is not clear why having the projection be sparse is desired.  Later, space (and time) efficiency is revealed as the motivation for the sparsity, but it would be helpful if the paper said this earlier.
Equation 6 seems to have an error, the probability should be P(w_t | w_t-1...) instead of P(w_t , w_t-1...) if this is to represent the standard LM objective (the probability of the corpus).

Instead of having |V| x m embeddings, the author(s) represented a word with a random, sparse, linear combination {1, 0, -1} of k vector of size m. The experiment on PTB dataset showed that k had to be somewhat close to |V| in order to achieve the comparable perplexity to a feed-forward NLM.

Overall, I am not sure what we could gain from this research direction. The advantage of this random encoding was to reduce the number of parameters for an embedding layer, but the results showed we gained much PPL from a 25% reduction in embedding size (Table 1). In addition, the fact that the random projections preserved the inner product (centered at zero) was probably not desirable. It might be more fruitful if these linear combinations were learned or sub-senses of words (e.g. [1]).

The experiments were quite extensive on the hyper-parameters and showed how the models performed under different settings. However, these were done using 1 dataset and also a simple feed-forward network (rather than LSTM). I can understand the point that training NNLM accelerates the experiments, but the author(s) should consider trying a simply LSTM model after the best settings had been discovered (e.g. Table 1). PTB also has a very unnatural vocabulary distribution as pointed out in [2]. Thus, it might be helpful to test the result on another dataset (e.g. WikiText).


Other comments
1. I do not get the point of bringing up NCE. Did you actually use NCE loss? Did you only refer to NCE as a weight tying which can be used in a standard XENT loss [3]? The first paragraph of 3.3 did not help clarify this point either.

2. In Figure 3, the baseline got different perplexity between 3(a) and 3(b). 

3. Shouldn't random indexing produce non-uniform numbers of non-zero entries depending on alpha? Why did you have an exact number of non-zero entries, s, in the experiments?

3. Some typos
- "... is that instead of trying to probability ..." =&gt; "... tying ..."
- "... All models sare trained ..." =&gt; "... are ..."
- "... Tho get the feature ..." =&gt; ?

The benefit is that the matrix which projects words into embedding space can then be much smaller, since the space of random projections can be much smaller than the vocab size. The idea is an interesting one, but this work is at too much of a preliminary stage for a top-tier conference such as ICLR. In its present state it would make for a potentially interesting paper at a targeted workshop.

More specific comments
--

The initial description of the language modeling problem assumes a particular decomposition of the joint probability, according to a particular application of the chain rule, but of course this is a modeling choice and not the only option (albeit the standard one).

The main problem with the paper is the use of simple baseline setups as the only experimental configuration:

o feedforward rather than recurrent network;
o use of the Penn Treebank dataset only;
o use of a small n for the n-grams.

All or at least some of these decisions would need to be relaxed to make a convincing paper.

The reasons for the use of the energy-based formulation are not clear to me. Is the energy-based model particularly well-suited to the random-projection setup, or are there other reasons for using it, independent of the use of random projections?

Just before equation 6 it says that the resulting vector representation is the *sum* of all the non-zero entries. But there are some minus ones in the random projection? 

The PPL expression at the bottom of p.5 doesn't look right. The index over which the sum happens is n, but n is fixed? So this looks like a sum with just one component in it, namely the first n-gram.

It looks like all the results are given on the test set. Did you not do any tuning on the validation data?

The plots in figure 4 are too small. It would be useful to have a table, like the one on the last page, which clearly shows the baseline vs. the random-projection model, with some description of the results in the main body of the text.

The overall presentation could be better, and I would encourage the authors to tidy the paper up in any subsequent submission. For example, there are lots of typos such as "instead of trying to probability of a target word".
