This data powers a variety of machine learning models for tasks such as image classification, language modeling, content recommendation, and advertising. However, training large models over all available data can be computationally expensive, creating a bottleneck in the development of new machine learning models. In this work, we develop a novel approach to efficiently select a subset of training data to achieve faster training with no loss in model predictive performance. In our approach, we first train a small proxy model quickly, which we then use to estimate the utility of individual training data points, and then select the most informative ones for training the large target model. Extensive experiments show that our approach leads to a 1.6x and 1.8x speed-up on CIFAR10 and SVHN by selecting 60% and 50% subsets of the data, while maintaining the predictive performance of the model trained on the entire dataset. Further, our method is robust to design choices.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">data selection, deep learning, uncertainty sampling</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">we develop an efficient method for selecting training data to quickly and efficiently learn large machine learning models.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">5 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SkxFGD7c2X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Review</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryzHXnR5Y7&amp;noteId=SkxFGD7c2X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1355 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1355 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">General:
The paper proposed an algorithm named Select Via Proxy(SVP), which can be used for data sampling. The idea is simple and straightforward: 1) use a proxy model to get decision boundary 2) train the large target model on the data points close to the decision boundary.

Strength:
1. Roughly this is a well-written paper. The main idea is quite clear to me.
2. Empirical validation of the experiments looks good. The results show that SVP help reduce the training time with ResNet. The author(s) also showed the influence of different quantifying uncertainty methods.

Possible Improvements:
1. In Related Work, several previous works were mentioned. Although the author(s) claimed that SVP can be combined with them, it's better to show the performance of SVP compared with them. This would show the significance of the work.
2. In the experiments, I was hoping to see how well SVP works on ImageNet. The problem is that: For ResNet152 and ResNet164, they are relatively too deep on such small data sets. Since the dimension of the data points(images) is not high, SVP can easily catch a reasonable decision boundary with a smaller model. I am almost sure ResNet20 is good enough to do this. I am more concerned about the situation where the capacity of the model is challenged by the size of the dataset. e.g. The data sets of autonomous driving are usually extremely large and even very deep models cannot be fully trained on that. 
3. The data points close to the decision boundary can be considered as tough data points, whose features might be hard to be caught by the model. If training model only on these data points, the trained model may just memorize tough data points and not learn the other data points from the data set. One solution is that, while training on tough data points, the model should also be trained on a small portion of well-learned data points. I don't think training only on the points close to the decision boundary is enough and was more expecting to see some discussion about this in the paper.

Conclusion:
My two biggest concerns are: 1) The algorithm is not tested on large data seta 2) The algorithm is not tested with the models of limited capacity. As a conclusion, I tend to vote for rejection.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HkxQhmG5nQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting approach to data selection, but needs comparative experiments</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryzHXnR5Y7&amp;noteId=HkxQhmG5nQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1355 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1355 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value"># Summary
The paper presents a method for identifying and selecting the most informative subset of the training dataset in order to reduce training time while maintaining test accuracy. The method consists of training a proxy model that is smaller and has been trained for fewer epochs, and which can optionally be ensembled. Experiments show promising results, indicating that some datasets can be reduced to half the size without impacting model performance.

# Quality
The paper appears sound and of good quality. Background literature is cited and the proposed method is discussed in sufficient detail.

I would, however, like to see some additional comparative experiments. All experiments are constructed to show that the method can indeed achieve accuracy comparable to the full model but with a smaller training set. I would like to see how it compares to existing strategies -- are there any reason to pick this method over existing ones?
Since the last sentence in section 2 states that the proposed method is orthogonal to previous subsampling techniques, and therefore can be combined with any of them, it would be interesting to see how SVP compares to these and whether a combination of, say, SVP and importance sampling will in fact achieve better performance than the importance sampling on its own.
Additionally, given the model's high resemblance to active learning, it would be interesting to see it compared to some prominent active learning methods.

# Clarity
The paper reads quite well. I particularly like the paragraph headlines, which makes it easy to get an overview of the paper.

The figures are generally nice and readable, except for figure 3, which I don't understand. Maybe I am missing it, but I can't find an explanation for what the rows and columns indicate, and the labels themselves should also be increased in size.

# Originality
I do not find the paper particularly novel. To me, the proposed method seems to be a variant of active learning, not orthogonal to this as it is claimed in section 2. The choice of surrogate model and uncertainty metric might be new, but the method itself boils down to uncertainty sampling, a well-known strategy in active learning.
However, I am happy to change my mind if the authors can explain to me exactly how their method differs from active learning.

# Significance
While techniques for speeding up training without sacrificing performance are, of course, always interesting, I find the proposed method to be rather incremental and not significant enough for ICLR. It would be better suited as a workshop paper.

# Other notes
In the last paragraph of section 1, you write that "Our proposed framework is robust to the choice of proxy model architecture." I am not sure what you mean by this. Do you mean that one can choose any model as the proxy (which is clearly correct) or do you mean that the method is "proxy agnostic" in the sense that any proxy model will work better than no proxy? If the latter is the case, I would like some arguments for this. Also, if the method is indeed proxy agnostic, it should be possible to remove the proxy completely and select the data in some other way.

The authors first train some light weighted proxy models, using these models to rank the data according to its uncertainty, and then pick the most uncertain subset to train the final model. Experiments on CIFAR10/SVHN/Amazon Review Polarity demonstrates the effectiveness.

In general, I think the authors did a decent job in showing that such a simple idea could surprisingly work well to boost NN training. I believe it will inspire future works on speeding up NN training. However, to form a solid ICLR publication, plenty of future works need to be done.

1)	I will not be fully convinced if an idea aiming to speed up, is only verified on small scale dataset (e.g., CIFAR10). It will be much better if there are large scale experiments conducted such as on ImageNet and WMT neural machine translation. 

2)	Please well position some related works. First, it would be more interesting and informative if some baselines in section 2 (especially those in “Optimization and Importance Sampling’), are compared with. Second, there are important related works omitted such as L2T [1], which also talks/shows the possibly of using partial training data to achieve speed up.

3)	Some writing issues: it would be better to *clearly* demonstrate the final accuracy of different models (i.e. ResNet 164 trained on whole data and selected subset), such as putting them into a table, but not merely showing them vaguely in the curves and text. I’m also note sure about the meaning of `epoch’ in Table 1: does it mean how many epochs the proxy model is trained? If so, I can hardly get the intuition of why smaller epochs works better. I noted a conjecture raised by the authors in the last sentence of paragraph “comparing different proxies”. However, I cannot catch the exact meaning.

Our key observation is that the behavior of a smaller model is a useful and efficient proxy for training data selection.  After evaluating entropy, loss, confidence, and margin as shown in Figure 5, we found limited differences in performance. Of course, the use of uncertainty as a quality metric is just one option among many. We are already looking at additional formulations that use intermediate activations and combine uncertainty sampling with other metrics that focus on diversity. Our preliminary results show improved performance for small fractions of the data. We plan to include these results in the final version of the paper. However, for us, the surprising result is that simple metrics from small proxy models are so effective.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
