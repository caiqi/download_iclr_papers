and receive it, real annotation often presents a mismatch between the form of a label
(say, one among many classes), and the form of an annotation (typically yes/no binary
feedback). To annotate examples corpora for multiclass classification, we might need to
ask multiple yes/no questions, exploiting a label hierarchy if one is available. To address
this more realistic setting, we propose active learning with partial feedback (ALPF), where
the learner must actively choose both which example to label and which binary question to
ask. At each step, the learner selects an example, asking if it belongs to a chosen (possibly
composite) class. Each answer eliminates some classes, leaving the learner with a partial
label. The learner may then either ask more questions about the same example (until
an exact label is uncovered) or move on immediately, leaving the first example partially
labeled. Active learning with partial labels requires (i) a sampling strategy to choose
(example, class) pairs, and (ii) learning from partial labels between rounds. Experiments
on Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our most effective method improves 26% (relative) in
top-1 classification accuracy compared to i.i.d. baselines and standard active learners given
30% of the annotation budget that would be required (naively) to annotate the dataset.
Moreover, ALPF-learners fully annotate TinyImageNet at 42% lower cost. Surprisingly,
we observe that accounting for per-example annotation costs can alter the conventional
wisdom that active learners should solicit labels for hard examples.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">7 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SkxYxO9kRX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>General reply to reviewers</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJfSEnRqKQ&amp;noteId=SkxYxO9kRX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1448 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">19 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1448 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">We would like to thank all three reviewers for their thoughtful and detailed reviews.

This leads to a simpler and more natural way of retrieving this information that can be of use many applications such as image classification. 

The paper is well-written and very easy to follow. The authors first present the overview of the learning scenario and then suggest three sampling strategies based on the existing AL insights (expected information gain, expected remaining classes, expected decrease in classes). 

As the labels that the algorithm has to then use are partial, they make use of a standard algorithm to learn from partial labels -- namely, minimizing a partial log loss. It would be nice to properly reference related methods in the literature in Sec. 2.1.

The way of solving both the learning from partial labels and the sampling strategies are not particularly insightful. Also, there is a lack of theoretical guarantees to show value of a partial label as compared to the true label. However, as these are not the main points of the paper (introduction of a novel learning setting), I see these as minor concerns.

Three different sampling strategies are used during active learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ALPF strategy outperforms existing baselines on the predicting accuracy under a limited budget.

This paper is well-written. The main ideas and claims are clearly expressed. ALPF combines active learning with learning from partial labels. This setting is interesting and important, especially when the number of categories is large and share some hierarchical structure. The experimental results are promising. My main concern about this work is the lack of theoretical guarantees, which is usually important for active learning paper. itâ€™s better to provide some analysis on the efficiency of ALPF to further improve the quality of the paper.
I have the following questions for the authors:
+Why vanilla active learning strategy does not work well? Which uncertainty measurement do you use here?
+The performances of this work heavily rely on the taxonomy of labels, while in some cases the taxonomy of labels is not tree structure but a graph, i.e. a label may belong to multiple hyper-labels. Can ALPF still work on these cases?

We would like to respond to your concerns briefly:

First, concerning your questions:
***Re the failure of vanilla active learning***
Since theoretical analysis guaranteeing the performance of active + deep learning has yet to be established, itâ€™s hard to say *why* vanilla uncertainty-sampling-based active learning doesnâ€™t work so well when applied on image classification datasets with convolutional neural networks. However, we are not the first to find this. Take for example the results Active Learning for Convolutional Neural Networks: A Core Set Approach (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00489.pdf)," target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00489.pdf),</a> which was published at ICLR 2018, where uncertainty sampling and even the more recent deep Bayesian active learning by disagreement perform no better than random on CIFAR 10 and only marginally better for CIFAR 100. In contrast, vanilla AL strategies have demonstrated promise on a number of NLP tasks (e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05697.pdf).

***Re the taxonomy of labels***
While tree-structured taxonomies are especially convenient, our methods do not in principle depend specifically on tree structure, requiring only a list of composite labels. One can draw a parallel to general formulations of the game twenty questions where the available set of questions neednâ€™t form tree. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion for future work and plan to evaluate our methods on with label ontologies like the MeSH labels (medical subject headings) used to annotate biomedical articles that do not form a strict tree hierarchy (some nodes have multiple parents). 

Regarding theoretical guarantees, we agree with the reviewer that establishing theoretical guarantees for active learning with partial labels is an especially exciting direction and plan to pursue future work in this direction. We note that generally there is a considerable gap between the theory of active learning and the practical methods established to cope with high dimensional data and modern classifiers and hope to close this gap in the future with rigorous analysis.

Training takes place through an active learning setting in which all training examples x_i are initially provided without their ground truth labels y_i. The learner issues queries of the form (x_i,c_j) where c_j is one of the given subsets of labels. The annotator only replies yes/no according to whether the true label y_i of x_i belongs to c_j or not. Hence, for each training example the learner maintains a "version space" containing all labels that are consistent with the answers received so far for that example. The active learning process consists of the following steps: (1) use the current learning model to score queries (x_i,c_j); (2) query the best (x_i,c_j); (3) update the model.
In their experiments, the authors use a mini-batched version, where queries are issued and re-ranked several times before updating the model. Assuming the learner generates predictive models which map examples to probability distributions over the class labels, several uncertainty measures can be used to score queries: expected info gain, expected remaining classes, expected decrease in remaining classes. Experiments are run using the Res-18 neural network architecture over CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny ImageNet, with training sets of 50k, 50k, and 100k examples. The subsets c_j are computed using the Wordnet hierarchy on the label names resulting in 27, 261, and 304 subsets for the three datasets. The experiments show the advantage of performing adaptive queries as opposed to several baselines: random example selection with binary search over labels, active learning over the examples with binary search over the labels, and others. 

This paper develops a natural learning strategy combining two known approaches: active learning and learning with partial labels. The main idea is to exploit adaptation in both choosing examples and queries. The experimental approach is sound and the results are informative. In general, a good experimental paper with a somewhat incremental conceptual contribution.

In (2) there is t+1 on the left-hand side and t on the right-hand side, as if it were an update. Is it a typo?

In 3.1, how is the standard multiclass classifier making use of the partially labeled examples during training?

How are the number of questions required to exactly label all training examples computed? Why does this number vary across the different methods?

What specific partial feedback strategies are used by AQ for labeling examples?

EDC seems to consistently outperform ERC for small annotation budgets. Any intuition why this happens?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1eMytqJ0Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Reply to Reviewer 1</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJfSEnRqKQ&amp;noteId=H1eMytqJ0Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1448 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">19 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1448 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thanks for your feedback. We are glad that you appreciated the usefulness of the setup, the soundness of the experiments, and the insights of the results. We are also grateful for your thoughtful questions and recommendations.

1) Yes, the t+1 is a mistake. Thanks for the catch! We will fix this in the camera ready version of the paper. 

2) A standard multi-class classifier cannot make use of the partially labeled data. The very purpose of these initial experiments was to establish as a sanity check that our setup for learning from partial labels with neural networks works in the first place (before adding the complexity of active learning). The point is to show that the model gets additional predictive performance as compared to if it only relied on the subset of data that had been fully annotated. 

3) One key feature of ALPF is that a better algorithm identifies the correct label with a smaller number of (binary) questions. To compute the number of questions asked, we *record* the number of queries required to conclusively identify the label of every example. Note that this requires at least 1 question for each example, but may be much faster than the naive approach of drilling through the whole label hierarchy fresh for each example.

Our experiments compare all three acquisition strategies with AQ (EIG, ERC, and EDC). The difference between AQ and ALPF is that AQ selects examples i.i.d., and chooses only which (possibly composite) label to query. By contrast, ALPF at each round selects both the example and the label, possibly moving on to a new example and leaving the previous example with a partial label.

There are two relevant observations to the reviewerâ€™s question. On Tiny ImageNet, ERC ends up spending the first 60K (the first two batch after warm-up) questions on just 32K distinct examples while EDC ends up querying 51K distinct examples. As we can see in Figure 2 (and not surprisingly), ERC obtains more exactly labeled examples early on, while EDC has less remaining classes overall. The fact that EDC consistently outperforms ERC early on suggests that given a very limited budget it might be better to coarsely but strategically annotate a larger dataset than to focus on obtaining more granular labels. How precisely this translates into improved classification performance is an interesting question and warrants deeper theoretical inquiry.
