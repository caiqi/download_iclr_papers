However, these linguistic features are impacted in a similar but different fashion by the normal aging process. Aging is therefore a confounding factor, whose effects have been hard for machine learning classifiers to isolate. 

In this paper, we show that deep neural network (DNN) classifiers can infer ages from linguistic features, which is an entanglement that could lead to unfairness across age groups. We show this problem is caused by undesired activations of v-structures in causality diagrams, and it could be addressed with fair representation learning. We build neural network classifiers that learn low-dimensional representations reflecting the impacts of dementia yet discarding the effects of age. To evaluate these classifiers, we specify a model-agnostic score $\Delta_{eo}^{(N)}$ measuring how classifier results are disentangled from age. Our best models outperform baseline neural network classifiers in disentanglement, while compromising accuracy by as little as 2.56\% and 2.25\% on DementiaBank and the Famous People dataset respectively. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Show that age confounds cognitive impairment detection + solve with fair representation learning + propose metrics and models.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">8 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1gKtZQfaQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Submission Withdrawn by the Authors</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylTHoR5Km&amp;noteId=H1gKtZQfaQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper126 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">09 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper126 Withdraw Submission</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Withdrawal confirmation: </span><span class="note_content_value">I have read and agree with the withdrawal statement on behalf of myself and my co-authors.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HklOAeXfpm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Withdrawn</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylTHoR5Km&amp;noteId=HklOAeXfpm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper126 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">09 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper126 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">We would like to thank all reviewers for giving comments, and will improve this paper accordingly.

The objective of the paper is not clear. Which of these are the objective:

- You want to build a classifier that is not influenced by the aging 
or 
- You want to *measure* the effect of disease by removing the age effect

- On page 3, in the v structure A-&gt;X-&lt;D, the mutual information between A and D is shown. In this structure, because A and D are independent of each other, the mutual information is zero. Do they mean conditional mutual information?

- In this problem, D is a cause for X. Controlling for the effect (X) does not make sense here. P(D|do(X)) is simply P(D) because of the causal principle. Do(X) will cut the arrow from D to X but will not affect the distribution of D.

- There is also a subtle difference between disease and diagnosis. The disease is the real status of the patient that we do not get to observe or expensive/unethical to measure while the diagnosis is kind of label given by a doctor. In this problem, it is not clear if D is decided based on A and X by the doctor or it is done differently. 

- The authors need to show the effectiveness of their method on simulated data.

- For such a small sample size, I am not convinced the NN is necessary. In a small sample size regime, the proposed metric results in high variance estimation because there will be a very small number of subjects in each bucket.

For objective, we want to (1) build classifiers that is not influenced by the ageing, and (2) measure how well this classifier do. The reason for doing (2) is that previous disentanglement scores are not satisfactory, for the scenario (detect disease while protecting certain attributes).

For the causality graph, there are indeed differences between D as Disease and Diagnosis. 
- An analogy for A-&gt;X&lt;-D is IQ-&gt;Score&lt;-Diligence. IQ and diligence are independent, but conditioning on observed scores, the confounding value of IQ affects the estimation of diligence. 
For instance: If a student's score is so-so, and we could infer (e.g., that student is the only one that got some trick questions correct) that the student is smart, then probably he didn't study hard.
- In training, traditional classifiers learn P(Diagnosis|x), which is influenced by A. We want the model to learn P(Diagnosis|do(X)). We will add in corresponding descriptions to avoid confusions.

We understand these datasets are small in comparison to traditional ML datasets. This is because acquiring clinical trial data is very expensive. The cognitive impairment detection, for example, usually require hours of testing per participant. 
- We use DementiaBank the largest publicly available one; and the other one we use, Famous People, is of similar size.
- We develop methods suitable for the small dataset size. E.g., (1) The number of age groups should be suitable when evaluating our disentanglement score. (2) Our disentanglement score considers both FP and FN instead of just one. This better depicts the model's behaviour.

For the choice of models, we use NN because MLP either outperforms or aligns with the best traditional classifier in accuracy. Also, our best NN-based models do better than (in disentanglement score) all traditional classifiers, while compromising only little accuracy. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rklEadB5hX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Theoretical and algorithmic novelty is not enough.

However, several aspects needs to be improved. 

1) Evidence for linguistic feature predicting age seems not enough i.e., the error reported in page 8 is approx. 40% of the overall range of the age in the two datasets considered; Hence the confounder SNR might not be strong to show significant changes/patterns in disentanglement scores (of Hardt et al) -- which is why all the deltas in Tables 1, 2 are very close. 

2) There is an implicit influence of the good-ness of input/linguistic features? How to account for that in the performance summaries? Also, any specific reason for choosing 2 and 5 groups/bins for age? 

3) The models in Table 2 should 'not' have significant differences in the ideal case -- is this correct? i.e., the disentanglement scores are doing reasonable job for all settings? Also, the authors suggest the improvements are mostly significant -- this should be more precise (back to exhaustive evaluations thing). 

4) The scale of disentanglement is difficult to interpret. Shouldn't the score be normalized by the group size to fix the range across all comparisons? 

5) What is the basis for presenting the four models? And it seems the simplest model is working best because, for the size of the dataset (small, unlike standard CV data), the non-simple models are over-parameterized and more non-linear (for the lack of a better phrase) to train?

For motivation, linguistic features contain age information, but also a lot more, affected by e.g., speaker differences. Therefore predicting the exact age from features are hard. However, simple DNNs give much better results than randomly guessing an age: the error is 37.5% of data range for Famous people and 15.6% for DementiaBank; it would be 50% if just predict mean. This shows that age information are entangled in the pre-computed linguistic features.  

For models, our models have some commons by design. They all have encoder(s) to encode features into "age-clean" embeddings. They all have an adversary to infer ages from embeddings. In addition to these basic mechanisms, they have some different add-on features that might or might not contribute to accuracy / disentanglements, dependent on datasets. In Famous People dataset, for example, model with autoencoder mechanism gives the best disentanglement. 

For evaluation, given the size of data, we somewhat arbitrarily chose to divide them into 2 and 5 groups. The number of groups impact the scores significantly, which goes against the purpose of normalization by group. There are improvements in disentanglement scores (t-tests in footnote of page 9) while compromising only little accuracy.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rke5HMasj7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Important problem.

"Age" is a confounder as it impacts both the narrative transcripts (due to change in cognitive abilities with age) and dementia (as one gets older they're more likely to get dementia). 

The paper proposes an adversarial approach which essentially learns to correctly predict dementia classification using narrative text but adversarially predicts "age" to deconfound the impact of "age". The paper also contributes by extending the fairness metric proposed by (Madras et. al. 18) to continuous attributes. The experimental results are shown on dementia datasets based on DementiaBank and FamousPeople to highlight the efficacy of the proposed approach.

The paper is well written and nicely describes the motivation for the problem being solved. That said, the paper has several weaknesses:

1). There is a rich literature these days on adversarially protecting sensitive attributes OR relatedly text understanding in confound-controlled settings. Some of the papers that the authors missed and should cite are: "Deconfounded Lexicon Induction for Interpretable Social Science"; "Interpretable Neural Architectures for Attributing an Adâ€™s Performance to its Writing Style" (both Pryzant et. al. '18); "Towards robust and privacy-preserving text representations." (Li et. al. 18) etc. 

Conditioning on that work, the methodological novelty of the proposed approach is little. I consider the extension of the metric proposed by (Madras et al. 18) to continuous sensitive attributes-- as touted by authors-- as straightforward. The only novel contribution in my eyes is the use of adversarial techniques for the important problem of dementia prediction-- a very important problem.

2). The paper discusses the weaknesses of the conventional approaches to the confound-controlled problem e.g. "Controlling A", "Controlling X", "Pre-adjusting X". However, it does not mention or compare against another set of popular approaches in statistics and social sciences for such problems-- matching-based approaches such as propensity-score matching which match dementia patient with a control who is most similar to them on attributes such as age.

3). Also, how would a conventional "residualization" approach fare relative to the proposed approach? That is, first regress (potentially non-linearly) narrative transcripts on age and compute the residual i.e. part of variance in text not explained by age. Finally, regress this residual on dementia. 

4). In the experiments section, the authors mention that they did not directly optimize the fairness metric i.e. FP/FN rates as it is non-differentiable. That is true, but they definitely need to provide that baseline as it will provide an upper-bound on the most fair solution that could be achieved and would help put the results in perspective. (There are methods out there for non-differentiable objective functions, though of course they might lack theoretical guarantees.  I believe that having any such baseline numbers is more important than having none at all.)

5). It's surprising that the simplest of the methods i.e. age-indep-simple and age-indep-autoencoder have the best fairness scores in Table 2. Why is that? Why don't more complex approaches based on consensus and entropy fare better? </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SJl4DTGzpX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Thank you + replies</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BylTHoR5Km&amp;noteId=SJl4DTGzpX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper126 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">09 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper126 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Tank you for taking time to read this paper and write comments!

For related works, we added comparisons to the following papers:
- (Pryzant et al, '18) Deconfounded lexicon induction for interpretable social science.
- (Pryzant et al, '18) Interpretable neural architectures for attributing an ad's performance to its writing style
- (Li et al, '18) Towards robust and privacy-preserving text representations.
- (Clare et al '18) Causal models adjusting for time-varying confounding - a systematic review of the literature.

For approaches, we'll add discussion / comparison to the following methods:
(1) Propensity-score matching. For each person, match with someone with the same diagnosis, very similar features, but very different age. Matching these people groups somewhat average out the effects of age. 
(2) Propensity-score reweighing. Compute an inverse-probability treatment weighting (IPTW) for each sample, so that the population is not biased against ages.
(3) Residualization approach: adjust the Y values that are not affected by A. Then fit traditional classifiers on (X-&gt; Y_adj)
(4) Optimizing the fairness scores, e.g., in (Zemel et al, '13)

After experiments, we will also add to discussions interpretations of their accuracies. For example, models with a lot more parameters than age-indep-simple might bring about overfitting, introducing additional bias that lowers the disentanglement scores.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
