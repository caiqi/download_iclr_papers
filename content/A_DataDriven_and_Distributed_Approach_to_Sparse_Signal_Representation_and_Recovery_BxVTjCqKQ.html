First, real-world signals can seldom be described as perfectly sparse vectors in a known basis, and traditionally used random measurement schemes are seldom optimal for sensing them. Second, existing signal recovery algorithms are usually not fast enough to make them applicable to real-time problems. In this paper, we address these two challenges by presenting a novel framework based on deep learning. For the first challenge, we cast the problem of finding informative measurements by using a maximum likelihood (ML) formulation and show how we can build a data-driven dimensionality reduction protocol for sensing signals using convolutional architectures. For the second challenge, we discuss and analyze a novel parallelization scheme and show it significantly speeds-up the signal recovery process. We demonstrate the significant improvement our method obtains over competing methods through a series of experiments. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Sparsity, Compressive Sensing, Convolutional Network</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We use deep learning techniques to solve the sparse signal representation and recovery problem.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HkgjfHOahX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Review: An interesting approach to data-driven compressed sensing</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1xVTjCqKQ&amp;noteId=HkgjfHOahX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper795 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper795 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">
This paper proposes a (CNNs) architecture for encoding and decoding images for compressed sensing. 
In standard compressed sensing (CS), encoding usually is linear and corresponds to multiplying by a fat matrix that is iid gaussian. The decoding is performed with a recovery algorithm that tries to explain the linear measurements but also promotes sparsity. Standard decoding algorithms include Lasso (i.e. l1 regularization and a MSE constraint) 
or iterative algorithms that promote sparsity by construction. 

This paper instead proposes a joint framework to learn a measurement matrix Phi and a decoder which is another CNN in a data-driven way. The proposed architecture is novel and interesting.  

I particularly liked the theoretical motivation of the used MSE loss by maximizing mutual information. 

The use of parallel convolutions is also neat and can significantly accelerate inference, which can be useful for some applications. 

The empirical performance is very good and matches or outperforms previous state of the art reconstruction algorithms D-AMP and Learned D-Amp. 

On comparisons with prior/concurrent work: The paper is essentially a CNN autoencoder architecture but specifically designed for compressed sensing problems. 
There is vast literature on CNN autoencoders including (Jiang 2017 and Shi 2017) paper cited by the authors. I think it is fine to not compare against those since they divide the images into small blocks and hence have are a fundamentally different approach. This is fine even if block-reconstruction methods outperform this paper, in my opinion: new ideas should be allowed to be published even if they do not beat SOTA, as long as they have clearly novel ideas. It is important however to discuss these differences as the authors have done in page 2.  

Specific comments: 

1. It would be interesting to see a comparison to D-Amp and LDAmp for different number of measurements or for different SNRs (i.e. when y = Phi x+ noise ). I suspect each method will be better for a different regime?

2. The paper: `The Sparse Recovery Autoencoder' (SRA) by Wu et al. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10175" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10175</a>
is related in that it learns both the sensing matrix and a decoder and is also focused on compressed sensing, but for non-image data. The authors should discuss the differences in architecture and training. 

3. Building on the SRA paper, it is possible that the learned Phi matrix is used but then reconstruction is done with l1-minimization. How does that perform for the matrices learned with DeepSSRR?

4. Why is Figure 1 going from right to left?

This is a nice paper with clear explanations and justifications. The experiments seem a little shakey.

Originality &amp; Significance:
I'm personally not familiar enough to say the theoretical work is original, but it is presented as so. However it seems significant. The numerical results do not seem extremely significant, but to be fair I'm not familiar with state of the art nearest neighbor results ie Fig 3.

Pros:
I like that you don't take much for granted. E.g. you justify using convolutional net in 2.1, and answered multiple of my questions before I could type them (e.g. why didn't you include nonlinearities between convolutions, why bother with cascaded convolutions, and what you mean by near-optimal).

Cons:
The visual comparisons in Figure 4 are difficult to see. DLAMP appears to be over-smoothing but in general it's hard to compare to low-ish resolution noisy-looking textures. I strongly recommend using a test image with a clear texture to illustrate your point (eg the famous natural test image that has on the side a tablecloth with zig-zag lines)

The horizontal error bars are obfuscated by the lines between markers in Fig 3a.

I don't understand Fig 3a. You are varying M, which is on the Y-axis, and observing epsilon, on the X-axis?

Questions:
Can you state what is novel about the discussion in the "Theoretical Insights" subsection of 2.1? I guess this is described in your abstract as "we cast the problem ... by using a maximum likelihood protocol..." but your contribution could be made more explicit. For example "We show that by jointly optimizing phi and lambda (sensing and recovery), we are maximizing the lower bound of mutual information between reconstructions (X) and samples (Y)" (that is my understanding of the section)

Why don't you use the same M for all methods in the Figure 3 experiments? ie why did you use a different M for numax/random versus deepSSRR/DCN?

Why do you choose 20-layers for the denoiser? Seems deep...

The last part of the last sentence of the 2nd paragraph of section 3.1 should be a complete sentence "though, with more number of parameters". Does that mean that the DCN has more parameters than the DeepSSRR?

Previous works have been proposed to jointly learn the signal sensing and reconstruction algorithm using convolutional networks. Authors do not consider them as the baseline methods due to the fact that the blocky reconstruction approach is unrealistic such as MRI. However, there is no empirical result to support his conclusion.  In addition, the comparisons to these methods can further convince the readers about the advantage of the proposed method.
 
It is not clear where the maximum deviation from isometry in Algorithm 1 is discussed since the MSE is used as a loss function.
 
Authors provided theoretical insights for the proposed algorithm. It indicates that the lower-bound of the mutual information is maximized and minimizing the mean squared error is a special case, but it is unclear why this can provide theoretical guarantee for the proposed method. More details are good for the connections between the theory and the proposed algorithm.
 
One of the contributions in this paper is the speed, so the results on the speed should be put in the main paper.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
