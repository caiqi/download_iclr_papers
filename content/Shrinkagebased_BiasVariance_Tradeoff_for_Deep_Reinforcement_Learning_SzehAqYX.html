A variety of different algorithms have been introduced and improved towards human-level performance. Although technical advances have been developed for each individual algorithms, there has been strong evidence showing that further substantial improvements can be achieved by properly combining multiple approaches with difference biases and variances. In this work, we propose to use the James-Stein (JS) shrinkage estimator to combine on-policy policy gradient estimators which have low bias but high variance, with low-variance high-bias gradient estimates such as those constructed based on model-based methods or temporally smoothed averaging of historical gradients. Empirical results show that our simple shrinkage approach is very effective in practice and substantially improve the sample efficiency of the state-of-the-art on-policy methods on various continuous control tasks.

Main focus of the work is to devise and adaptive combination scheme for policy gradient estimators. Authors claim that by using the statistical shrinkage estimators combining different gradients that have different bias-variance trade-off would provide better mean-square error than each of those individual gradient estimators. The key observations made by the authors are that gradients computed by on-policy methods would provide nearly unbiased estimators with very high variance while the gradients obtained by the off-policy methods in particular model based approaches would provide highly biased estimators with low variance. Proposed statistical tool to combine gradients is James-Steim shrinkage estimator. JS estimator provides strong theoretical guarantees for Gaussian cases but some practical  heuristics tor more complex non-Gaussian cases. Authors do not discuss  whether the JS estimator actually suitable for this task given the fact that strong assumptions of the underlying statistical approach is violated. They also do not go into any discussion about theoretical guarantees nor they provide any exposures or intuitions about that. The scope of the experiments is very limited. Given the fact that there is no theory behind the claims and the lack of strong evidence I believe this paper does not cut the requirements for publication.

To improve please add significantly more empirical evidence, provide more discussion about theoretical ground work and discussion about the suitability of the JS estimators when its required assumptions are not satisfied.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rylMEf6qn7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Promising, yet inconclusive evaluations</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1z9ehAqYX&amp;noteId=rylMEf6qn7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1102 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1102 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper presents two algorithms that improve on PPO by using James-Stein (JS) shrinkage estimator. The first algorithm, PPO-MBS, combines low bias of on-policy methods with low variance of model-based RL algorithms. The second, PPO-STS, uses JS to create a statistical momentum and reduce variance of the PPO algorithm. Both algorithms are evaluated on Mujoco environments aiming to show improvements in average cumulative reward, reduced bias and variance.

The paperâ€™s topic is highly relevant, as the authors point out, the current state of the art in RL is largely divided between model-based and model-free methods. This paper aims at bridging the gap, and taking advantage of both sides. The writing is clear and concise, with all the math properly introduced. The proposed methods are interesting and novel. As far as I am aware, this is solid and unexplored approach with potentially significant impact.

There are two concerns with this paper. First, the evaluation results are promising, yet not fully convincing. It appears that 5 million steps is not sufficient for the policy convergence for any of the tasks (average reward keeps increasing). At the same time the variance gap (Figure 1) is reducing. 
- As the training continues, does the variance for PPO-MBS become larger?
- Similar question for the average reward - the advantage of the PPO-MBS vs. comparison methods seems to be reducing. What happens with the additional training?
- How do the trajectories and behavior of the Walker2D (and other) look with PPO-MBS vs. others - is the higher average reward indicative of the qualitatively better behavior?
- Why do Walker2D and Hopper increase \alpha over time, while Swimmer and Reacher lean more towards mode model based policy over time?
- Is there something significant about the structure of the problems?
- Similar questions arise from the evaluation of the PPO-STS - it appears that the training is even less complete in this case, rendering the conclusions about the quality of the learned policy at convergence invalid.
- Why are Humanoid and Ant not evaluated on PPO-MBS? The authors should extend the training to convergence on all problems, and present the results including movies of example trajectories of all environments for both algorithms in the supplementary material.

Second, the paper introduces two competing methods.  While, the authors compare them directly,  they do not discuss how the two methods relate to each other. In the Reacher and Hopper task seems like all three methods perform about the same, and in the Hopper PPO-STS even performs worse than the baseline. This makes it difficult to assess the significance of the exposition. When should one be used, and when the other one is better?

The authors should consider either a) splitting the paper into two focusing each paper on a single algorithm with more in-depth evaluations and discussions, or b) combining the two algorithms into ones. In any case, further analysis that illuminates when the methods should be used, and how they improve the training are needed.

Two versions are suggested: The on-policy gradients is shrinked either towards (i) model based gradient, or towards (ii) a delayed average of previous on-policy gradients. Empirically, both methods have better performance than the baseline.

The paper is clearly written and well motivated. Some details are lacking that would be of interest to the reader and to make the results reproducible. For example how is \hat Q estimated? The trick that is referred to in the end of page about only simulating short horizon trajectories deserves more detail. I would suggest providing more details, in the text and/or in the two algorithms.

The authors claim that JS estimator for gradient estimation in RL has not been used before. I am also not aware of any other work, but have also not been looking after that line of work. The paper seems to be a good contribution to the ever increasing literature of how to improve deep RL.

Minors:
\hat \theta on RHS in eq (7) should be \bar \theta ? Othewise, what is \hat \theta?
