A priori one might imagine that the loss function looks like a typical function from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}$ - in particular, nonconvex, with discrete global minima.  In this paper, we prove that in at least one important way, the loss function of an overparameterized neural network does not look like a typical function.  If a neural net has $n$ parameters and is trained on $d$ data points, with $n&gt;d$, we show that the locus $M$ of global minima of $L$ is usually not discrete, but rather an $n-d$ dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$.  In practice, neural nets commonly have orders of magnitude more parameters than data points, so this observation implies that $M$ is typically a very high-dimensional subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">10 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1lAj8TRhm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>The result is based on heuristic, hence an unrigorous work.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyezvsC5tX&amp;noteId=r1lAj8TRhm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper241 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper aims to characterize the loss landscape of over-parameterized neural networks, which fit a fixed training dataset exactly. The authors try to use the regular value theorem to show the set of global minima is a smooth $n - d$ dimensional submanifold of $R^n$, where $n$ is the number of parameters of a neural network and $d$ is the number of data. The proof of this claim is only heuristic, namely, by Sard's theorem, the set of critical values of a smooth function between two smooth manifolds has Lebesgue measure zero. Unfortunately, this is insufficient to assert that global minimum zero, if exists, is a regular value. There is a similar attempt to study this problem at CVPR 2018 (check the link below), which shows that global minimum zero is not a regular value of the loss function with over-parameterized neural networks.

We'd like to clarify that after the statement of Theorem 2.1, we give a heuristic for why one might expect this theorem to be true.  We then give a formal proof of the theorem.  We do not claim that 0 is a regular value of $L$.  Rather, the proof establishes that after perhaps an arbitrarily small perturbation of the data set, 0 is a regular value of each $f_i$.  

Thank you for bringing our attention to the paper mentioned.  We did not see it stated in that paper that "global minimum zero is not a regular value of the loss function with over-parameterized neural networks", but in any case, this paper does not contradict that statement.  Namely, in this paper, we do not prove that 0 is a regular value of the loss function $L$.

It consists of three main results:

a) (Theorem 2.1) If the output of the network is a smooth function of its parameters and global minimum with zero squared loss is attainable, then the locus of global minima is a smooth $n - d$ dimensional submanifold of R^n.
b) (Lemma 3.3) A neural network with a hidden layer as wide as the number of data points can attain global minima with zero loss.
c) (Theorem 4.1) If a neural network has a hidden layer as wide as the number of data points and is a smooth function of its parameters, then the locus of global minima with loss zero is a smooth $n - d$ dimensional submanifold. This is just a combination of a) and b).

I think the only contribution of this paper is Theorem 2.1. It is already well-known (e.g., Zhang et al. 16’) that a network with a hidden layer as wide as the number of data can easily attain zero empirical error. The authors claim that it is an extension over ReLU, but the extension is almost trivial. Theorem 4.1 is just a corollary from Theorem 2.1 and Lemma 3.3.

Theorem 2.1 is an interesting observation, and its implication that the Hessian at minima has only d positive eigenvalues is interesting and explains empirical observations. 

From my understanding, however, the n - d dimensional submanifold argument can be applied to any regular values of H(w,b) (not necessarily global minima), so the theorem is basically saying there are a lot of equivalence classes in the parameter space that outputs exactly the same outcome. If my understanding is correct, this result does not give us any insight into why SGD can find global minima easily, because we can apply the same proof to spurious local minima and say, “look, the locus of this spurious local minimum is a high-dimensional submanifold, so it is easy to get stuck at poor local minima.”

Moreover, the notation used in this paper is not commonly used in deep learning community, thus might confuse the readers. $n$ is more commonly used for the number of data points and $d$ is used for some dimension. Also, there are overloading uses of $p$: 
* In Section 2.1 it is used for the dimension of the input space
* In the proof of Prop 2.3 it is now a vector in R^n
* In section 3 it is now a parameter vector of a neural network
* Back to the input dimension in Lemma 3.3 and Section 4

Also, the formulation of neural networks in Section 3 is very non-standard. If you are to end up showing some result on standard fully-connected feed-forward networks, why not just use, for example, $W_2 \sigma(W_1 x_i + b_1) + b_2$? To me, this graph theoretical formulation only adds confusion. Also at the end of page 4, there is a typo: the activation function (\sigma) must be applied after the summation.

Overall, I believe this paper does not meet the standards of ICLR at the moment. I would recommend rejection.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJehBLmkCm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Author response</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyezvsC5tX&amp;noteId=rJehBLmkCm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper241 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">19 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper241 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">We thank the reviewer for the helpful feedback.  

Thanks for suggesting some modifications of the letters used and catching a typo.  As to the definition of neural networks, we state a fairly general definition because that is the setting of Theorem 2.1.  We only restrict to the special case of a fully connected feedforward network in Theorem 2.3.

Now we turn to the reviewer's central concern.  The proof that $M = L^{-1}(0)$ is a manifold of dimension $n-d$ depends in an important way on the fact that we are studying the pre-image of 0, and this argument would not apply to any other minima - not even global minima of $L$ if the value of $L$ at the global minimum is not 0.  It is essential to the proof that 0 has the property that the sum of $d$ nonnegative numbers is 0 if and only if each summand is 0.  

We would not characterize Theorem 2.1 as "saying there are a lot of equivalence classes in the parameter space that outputs exactly the same outcome".  It is true that there may be multiple parameters that name the same function, e.g. there are many symmetries if ReLU is used as the activation function.  However, the parameters in $M$ generally will not all be names for the same function - rather, they encode many different functions, all of which share the property that they pass through the given $d$ data points.  

As a simplest example, consider a parameter space of lines in $R^2$, y=ax+b.  If we ask for all the lines that pass through the point $(1,3)$, we can find many distinct lines (the graphs of distinct functions) that pass through the point.  They are different lines - what they have in common is that they all pass through the point $(1,3)$.  </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rkgw4upgAX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Reply to the response</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyezvsC5tX&amp;noteId=rkgw4upgAX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper241 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">20 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper241 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">I appreciate the authors for the response. 

I still do not understand why “global minimum with zero” is so important in the proof of Theorem 2.1. It just says that (0,0,...,0) is a regular value of H (or \tilde H), so M is a smooth n-d dim submanifold (if not empty). What if I pick another regular value (let's say, (1,0,...,0))? What prevents me from applying the same argument to these regular values?</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HklQuKk-0m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Reply</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyezvsC5tX&amp;noteId=HklQuKk-0m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper241 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">20 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper241 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thank you for the reply.  We are glad to have the opportunity to clear up this point.  There are two functions - the loss function L we are interested in, and an auxiliary function H we construct to help us understand the geometry of L.  L is a function from R^n to R, while H is a function from R^n to R^d.  

You are entirely correct that if one takes any regular value (r_1, ..., r_d) of H, the preimage of that point is a smooth codimension $n-d$ dimensional submanifold.  However, in general, H^{-1}(r_1, ... r_d) is not L^{-1} of anything.  The special property of 0 that we are using is that L^{-1}(0) exactly equals H^{-1}(0,...0).  </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BkeYca75nX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>The results from the paper are sort of known in previous literature, yet the proof in the paper was still smart and innovative. </a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyezvsC5tX&amp;noteId=BkeYca75nX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper241 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper241 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper gave an interesting theoretical result that the global minima of an overparameterized neural network is a high-dimensional sub-manifold. This result is particularly meaningful as it connected several previous observations about neural networks and a indirect evidence for why overparameterization for deep learning has been so helpful empirically.

The proof in the paper was smart and the rough logic was quite easy to follow. The minor issue is that the proof in the paper was too sketchy to be strict. For example, in proof for Thm 2.1, the original statement about Sard’s theorem was about the critical values, but the usage of this theorem in the proof was a little indirect. I can roughly see how the logic can go through, but I still hope the author can give more detailed explaining about this part to make the proof more readable and strict.

Overall, I think the result in this paper should be enough to justify a publication. However, there’re still limitations of the result here. For example, the result only explained about the fitting on training data but cannot explain at all why overfitting is not a concern here. It also didn’t explain why stochastic gradient descent can find these minima empirically. In particular, even though the minima manifold is n-d dimensional, it’s still a zero-measure set which will almost never get hit with a random initialization. Of course, these are harder questions to explore, but maybe worthy some discussion in the final revision.

We'd be happy to provide more details in the proof of Theorem 2.1.  Would the following clarification help?  The statement of Sard's theorem on wikipedia is that under certain conditions, the critical values of a function $f$ are measure 0.  An equivalent and alternative formulation which we use in this paper is that under those conditions, the regular values of $f$ are full measure.  

The reviewer suggests several further directions, which we think are valuable.  We have also wondered about many of these, but don't at the time have answers to them.  We hope this paper will serve as a first step for exploring the more difficult questions the reviewer brings up.  </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SkgSSMfBnQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A short and concise theoretical paper, but I find the contribution limited</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyezvsC5tX&amp;noteId=SkgSSMfBnQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper241 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">30 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper241 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper shows that the set of global minimums of an overparametrized network with smooth activation function is almost surely a high dimensional manifold. In particular, the dimension of this manifold is exactly n-d, where n is the number of parameters and d is the number of datas. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first proper proof of such non-surprising result.  

The theoretical analysis is a straightforward combination of neural network's expressiveness result and some classical theorems in the field of differential topology. However, the assumption on the overparametrized neural network is somehow unrealistic since it requires that at least one layer has no less than d neurons, which is as many as the number of datas. This is usually not the case. Moreover, the result is to some extent "asymptotic", in the sense that a small perturbation in terms of data may be required in order to make the statement holds.  

More importantly, the result does not provide any useful characterization distinguishing stationary point/local minimum versus global minimum. It might be possible that the set of stationary points is also a manifold with very high dimension, which is indeed supported by the argument listed in the bottom of page 7: "the Hessian of the loss function tended to have many zero eigenvalues, some positive eigenvalues, and a small number of negative eigenvalues". It is possibly the case that the set of stationary points has even higher dimension. This suggests that the dimensionality itself is not right indicator, but the difference in terms of dimension between different type of stationary points that matters. 

Overall, the paper is short and concise but I find the contribution a bit limited.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rkgAlW71AQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Author response</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyezvsC5tX&amp;noteId=rkgAlW71AQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper241 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">19 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper241 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">We thank the reviewer for the helpful feedback.  This review brings up three main points, which we address here.

1.  We prove two theorems in this paper.  The first theorem holds very generally, and requires almost no assumptions about the architecture of the neural net.  Informally, one can think of this theorem as saying that one should generically expect the locus $M=L^{-1}(0)$ to be a manifold of dimension $n-d$.  The second theorem invokes several assumptions.  The purpose of these assumptions is simply to prove that $M$ is nonempty.  We expect that $M$ is nonempty in many cases beyond what we prove here, and leave it to future work.  

But one way to frame it is that as soon as your neural network, whatever it is, has the capacity to perfectly fit the training data, then the dimension of $M$ is $n-d$.  So if no layer has width $d$ but you know that your network has the capacity to perfectly fit the training data, the conclusion of the second theorem still holds. 

2.  It is true that a small perturbation of the data may be necessary, but this perturbation can be chosen as small as you like.  To be precise, if you fix any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, a perturbation such that each new label is within $\epsilon$ of the original label can be found for which the theorem holds.  

3.  This is a good point.  We are not currently able to compute the dimension of the locus of local but non-global minima.  However, while it is logically possible for loci of local non-global minima to have large dimensions, even larger than the dimension of the locus of global minima $M$, we would not expect this to be the case.  

A generic function has isolated critical points.  For a positive dimensional critical manifold to appear requires something special to happen.  In this paper we show that something special indeed happens at the locus of global minima $M = L^{-1}$, and we prove that its dimension is positive.  However, our argument relies on the fact that we are looking at the preimage of 0.  It would not apply to any other minima.  We agree that it would be interesting to study the dimension of the loci of local non-global minima.
