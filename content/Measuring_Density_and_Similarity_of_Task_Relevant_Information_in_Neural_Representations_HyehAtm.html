Here it is anyways.

Review:

This paper attempts to answer two questions: how densely is information included in sentence representations and how similar are encodings from encoders learned from different tasks?

Pros:
	1) This paper analyzes representation from a perspective that seems distinct from previous work. It is somewhat in-line with work stating that NNs are heavily overparameterized, and this work might be considered how overparameterized the representations are for NLP tasks.
	2) They present a fairly new method for trying to predict what tasks might be useful pretraining for other tasks.
	3) Their motivation, thought process, and formalism for their method is well-written and very clear, if almost too long.

Cons: 
Viewing this paper as making a methods contribution, I think the proposed approach is somewhat limited: 
	1) the method is only applicable to linear classifiers. I understand practically the decision to use only linear classifiers, but this decision limits the set of representations that can be fairly studied with this method to only representations just before the final linear layer, as using other parts of the model's internal representation are confounded by the fact that they are optimized for use in non-linear models.
	2) the method is not comparable across tasks with the different input/output format (slightly mitigated by the fact that you can recast tasks, but it's hard to overcome the fundamental limitation of one input vs two input tasks without introducing some weirdness)
	3) the method seems limited to sentence-to-vector models
Also, it'd be nice to give the upper bound on the quality of the approximation for the proposed greedy algorithm (I imagine it's something like (1 - 1/e) and the runtime.
	
As an analysis paper, which I think is more compelling than as a methods paper, the results are fairly interesting, but there isn't enough discussion of the results and I have some concerns regarding the experiments:
	4) it would have been nice to have more quick experiments to sanity check the method for predicting transfer learning. Using the predicted transfer between SST2 and SST5 is a good starting point, but there could, and I think should, have been more, e.g.: between random subsets of the same task, between different genres within MNLI, between MNLI and SNLI. 
	5) without a description of how the transfer learning is done, it's really hard to say how accurate these "gold" rankings of transfer learning are or what confounders are potentially introduced in their transfer learning approach
	6) I think there needed to be some explanation, even just a one sentence explanation of how hyperparameters were chosen, especially the \alpha parameter. How quickly does the algorithm pick the entire set as \alpha approach 1?
The discussion of results is very short relative to the density of the experiments and plots. The early exposition explaining everything mathematically and intuitively is nice, but I think the notation was somewhat superfluous and could have been condensed to include more analysis/discussion of the results.


Style / Presentation
	1) It'd be nice if each task was the same color across plots in Figure 2
	2) typos: section 3, p2: "...we first define accuracy score of the best classifier..."; section 1, last p: "...transferring the knowledge acquired therefrom to improve performance..."
	3) There's some related work analyzing contextual representations (outside sentence-to-vector) that would be worthwhile to mention, e.g. <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1179" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1179</a>

The second thing the paper tries to quantify is how well representations learned for one task can be fine tuned for another. Experiments are conducted with 4 different representation technique on a dozen or so tasks.

Quick summary: While I liked aspects of this -- including the motivation of having a lightweight way of understanding how well representations transfer across tasks, overall my concerns surrounding the methodology and some missing analysis leads me to believe this needs more work before it is ready for publication.

Quality: Below average
I believe the proposed techniques have some flaws which hurt the eventual method. There are also concerns about the motivations behind parts of the technique.

Clarity: Fair
There were some experimental details that were poorly explained but in general the paper was readable.

Originality: Fair
There were some nice ideas in the work but I remain concerned about aspects of it.

Significance: Below average
My concern is that the flaws in the method do not make it conducive to use as is.


Strengths / Things I liked:

+ I really liked the motivating problem of being able to (hopefully cheaply / efficiently) estimate transfer potential to understand how well representations will perform on a different task.

+ Multiple representations and tasks experimented with

Weaknesses / Things that concerned me:
(In no specific order)

- (W1) Adversely affected by rotations: One of my big concerns with the work is the way the CFS is computed. While it seems ok to estimate these different metrics using only linear models, my concern with this is that the linear models are only given a subset of the **exact** dimensions of the original representations. This is very much unlike the learning objectives of most of these representation learning methods and hence is highly biased and dependent on the actual methods and the random seeds used and the rotations it performs. (In many cases the representations are used starting with a fully connected layer bottom layer on top of the representations and hence rotations of the representations do not affect performance)

Let's take an example: Say there is a single dimension of the representation that is a perfect predictor of a task. Suppose we rotated these representations. Now the signal from the original dimension is split across multiple dimensions and hence the CFS may be deceivingly high.

To me this is a big concern as different runs of the same representation technique can likely have very different CFS scores based on initializations and random seeds.

- (W2) Related to the last line: I did not see any experiments / analysis showing how stable these different numbers are across different runs of the representation technique. Nor did I see any error bars in the experiments. This again greatly concerned me as I am not certain how stable these metrics are.

- (W3) Baselines for transfer learning: I felt this was another notable oversight. I would have liked to see results for both trivial baselines like random ranking as well as more informed baselines where we can estimate transfer potential using say k representation techniques, and then use that to help us understand how well it would do on the other representations. This latter baseline is a zero-cost baseline as it is not even dependent on the method.

- (W4) Metrics for ranking of transfer don't make sense (and some are missing) : I also don't understand how "precision" and NDCG are used as metrics. Based on my understanding the authors rank (which itself is questionable) the different tasks in order of potential for transfer and then call this the "gold" set. How is precision and NDCG calculated from this?

More importantly I don't believe looking at rank alone is sufficient since that completely obscures the actual performance numbers obtained via transfer. In most cases I would care about how well my model would perform on transfer not just which tasks I should transfer from. I would have wanted to understand something like the correlation of these produced scores with the actual ground truth performance numbers.

- (W5) Multi-task learning: I did not see any mention or experiments of what can be expected when the representations are themselves trained on multiple tasks. (This seems like something that could easily be done in the empirical analysis as well and would provide richer empirical signals as well)

- (W6) Motivation for CFS: I still don't fully understand the need to understand the density of the representation (especially in the manner proposed in the paper). Why is this an important problem? Perhaps expanding on this would be helpful

- (W7) Alternatives to CFS / Computational concerns: A big concern I had was the computational expense of the proposed approach. Unfortunately I did not see any discussion about this in the paper or empirically.

I find this striking because I can easily come up with cheaper alternatives to get at this "density". For example using LASSO / LARS like methods you can perhaps figure out a good reduced dimension set more efficiently.

If I were to go through the computation of then why not just train a smaller version of that representation technique instead and **directly** see how well it can encode data in k dimensions via that technique / for that task?

Alternatively why not try using a factorization technique to reduce the rank and then see how well the method does for different ranks?

- (W7b) Likewise I wonder if we could just measure transfer more directly as well and why we need to go via these CFS sets

- (W8) The proposed  CLF weight difference method has some concerning aspects as well. For example say we had two task with exact opposite labels. They would have a very low weight difference score though they are ideal representations for each other. Likewise looking at a difference of weight vectors seems arbitrary in other ways as well.

Summary:

This work attempts to define two kinds of metrics (metrics for information density and for information similarity) for the sake of automatically detecting similarity between tasks so that transfer learning can be done more efficiently. The concepts are clearly explained, and the metric for information density seems to match up with intuitions coming out of forward selections approaches. The metric for information transfer seems to be the commonplace metric that other works default to when they show that pre-trained representations are effective on downstream tasks. It is not clear that the notion of similarity through classifier weights makes sense, but see below for clarification questions. The problem addressed (automatic similarity scoring of tasks) is important for transfer learning, and thus the results have potential to be very impactful if they generalize to other kinds of tasks; as is, they seem to apply only to classification tasks, but that is a good step.

Pros:

Clearly written; experiments on the datasets chosen do seem to suggest that the proposed methods have potential. Brings in nice intuition from forward feature selection. An important problem with potential for high impact.


Cons:

It is not clear to me that the classifier difference metric is well-defined. Is there a constraint on the CFS and classifiers that ensure the difference between the weights really captures what is suggested? Is it not the case that classifier weights could come out quite different despite the tasks being quite similar if the linear classifiers learned to capitalize on dissimilar, yet equally fruitful patterns in the input features?

Do you have thoughts on how this could be applied outside the context of sentence representations and further outside the context of classification? Those seem to be quite limiting features of these methods, which is not to say that they are not useful in that realm, but only to clarify my understanding of their possible scope of application.

These classification datasets are often so close, that I do wonder whether even simpler methods would work just as well. For example, clustering on bags-of-words might also show that SST, SST-fine, and IMDb are close/similar/transferable. The same could be said for SICK and SNLI. It would be nice to see a comparison to such baselines in order to get a sense of how the proposed methods give insights that other unsupervised or supervised methods might give just as well. Otherwise, it is hard to tell how significant these correlations are. Since the end goal is to determine transferability of tasks and not the methods, it does seem like there are simpler baselines that you could compare against.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SyefBu5O3m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An interesting direction, but limited apparent utility</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hye64hA9tm&amp;noteId=SyefBu5O3m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1490 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1490 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes simple metrics for measuring the "information density" in learned representations. Overall, this is an interesting direction. However there are a few key weaknesses in my view, not least that the practical utility of these metrics is not obvious, since they require supervision in the target domain. And while there is an argument to be made for the inherent interestingness of exploring these questions, this angle would be more compelling if multiple encoder architectures were explored and compared. 

+ The overarching questions that the authors set out to answer: How task-specific information is stored and to what extent this transfers, is inherently interesting and important. 

+ The proposed metrics and simple and intuitive.

+ It is interesting that a few units seem to capture most task specific information. 

- The envisioned scenario (and hence utility) of these metrics is a bit unclear to me here. As noted by the authors, transfer is most attractive in low-supervision regimes, w.r.t. the target task. Yet the metrics proposed depend on supervision in the target domain. If we already have this, then -- as the authors themselves note -- it is trivial to simply try out different source datasets empirically on a target dev set. It is argued that this is an issue because it requires training 2n networks, where n is the number of source tasks. I am unconvinced that one frequently enough has access to a sufficiently large set of candidate source tasks for this to be a real practical issue. 

- The metrics are tightly coupled to the encoder used, and no exploration of encoder architectures is performed. The LSTM architecture used is reasonable, but it would be nice to see how much results change (if at all) with alternative architectures.

- The CFS metric depends on a hyperparameter (the "retention ratio"), which here is arbitrarily set to 80% without any justification.

- What is the motivation for the restriction to linear models? In the referenced probing paper, for example, MLPs were also used to explore whether attributes were coded for 'non-linearly'.
