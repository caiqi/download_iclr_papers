The key idea behind this method is to learn a sense embedding tensor using a skip-gram style training objective. The objective defines the probability of contexts marginalised over latent sense embeddings. The paper uses Gumbel-softmax reparametrization trick to approximate sampling from the discrete sense distributions. The method also uses a separate hyperparameter to help scale the dot product appropriately. 

Strengths:

1. The technique is a well-motivated solution for a hard problem that builds on the skip-gram model for learning word embeddings.
2. A new manual evaluation approach for comparing sense induction approaches.
3. The empirical advance while relatively modest appears to be significant since the technique seems to yield better results than multiple baselines across a range of tasks. 

Suggestions:

1. The number of senses is fixed to three. This is a bit arbitrary, even though it is following some precedence. I like the information in the appendix that shows how to handle cases when there are duplicate senses induced for words that dont have many senses. It would be useful to know how to handle the cases where a word can have more than three senses. Given that the authors have a way of pruning duplicate senses, it would have been interesting to try a few basic methods that select the number of senses per word dynamically. 

2. The evaluation includes word similarity task and crowdsourcing for sense intrusion and sense selection. These provide a measure of intrinsic quality of the sense based embeddings. However, as Li and Jurafsky (2015) point out, typically applications use more powerful models that use a wide context. It is not clear how these improvements to sense embeddings will translate in these settings. It would have been useful to have at least one or two end applications to illustrate this. 


3. Given that the empirical gains are not quite consistent, I would encourage the authors to specifically argue why this particular method should be favoured over other existing methods. The related work discussion merely highlights methodological differences. For example, the contrast with Lee and Chen (2017) seems to be only that of differentiability. Is the claim that differentiability is desirable because this allows for fine tuning in applications? If this is the case then it will be nice to have this verified. 

4. The lower bound on the log likelihood objective is good but what are we supposed to take away from it? Is it that there is an interpretation that allows us to get away with negative sampling? 

Overall I like the paper. It presents an application of the Gumbel-softmax trick for sense embeddings induction and shows some empirical evidence for the usefulness of this idea, including some manual evaluation. 

I think the evaluation could be strengthened with some end applications and much crisper arguments on why the method is preferable over other methods that achieve comparable performance.

  This paper extends the skipgram model using one vector per sense of a word. Based on this, the paper proposes two models for training sense embeddings: One where the word senses are marginalized out with attention over the senses, and the second where only the sense with highest value of attention contributes to the loss. For the latter case, the paper uses a variant of Gumbel softmax for training. The paper shows evaluations on benchmark datasets that shows that the Gumbel softmax based method is competitive or better than other methods. Via a crowdsourced evaluation, the paper shows that the method also produces human interpretable clusters.

* Review
  This paper is generally well written and presents a plausible solution for the problem of discovering senses in an unsupervised fashion.
  
  If \beta=0, then we get SASI, right? How well does this perform on the non-contextual word similarity task? Also, on the crowd sourced evaluation? The motivation for the hard attention/Gumbel softmax is to learn sense representations that are distinguishable. But do the experiments test this? 

  There's something strange about Eq 6. If I understand this correctly, \tilde{c_i} is the context and c_j^i is the j^th context word. Then P(c_j^i | w, \tilde{c_i}) should be 1 because the context is given, right? While the motivation for the right hand side makes sense, the notation could use work.
  
  The description of how the number of senses is pruned in section 3.1 seems to be a bit of a non sequitur. It is not clear whether this is used in the experiments and if so, how it compares. The appendix gives more details, but it seems a bit out of place even then because the evaluations don't seem to use it.


* Minor comments
  There are some places where the writing could be cleaned up.
  - Eq 16 changes the notation for the sense embeddings and the context words from earlier, say Eq 12.
  - Parenthetical citations would be more appropriate in some places Eg: above Eq 3, in footnote 3
  - Page 6, above 6.2: Figure-Figure?
  - Page 9, Agreement paragraph: hight -&gt; highest

The main idea is to use scaled Gumbel softmax as the sense selection method instead of soft or hard attention, which is the novelty and contribution of this paper.
In addition, the authors proposed a new evaluation task, contextual word sense selection, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate the semantic meaningfulness of sense embeddings.
The proposed model achieves comparable performance on traditional word/sense intrinsic evaluation and word intrusion test as previous models, while it outperforms baselines on the proposed contextual word sense selection task.

While the scaled Gumbel softmax is the claimed novelty, it is more like an extension of the original MUSE model (Lee and Chen, 2017), which proposed the sense selection and representation learning modules for learning sense-level embeddings.
The only difference between the proposed one and Lee and Chen (2017) is Gumbel softmax instead of reinforcement learning between sense selection and representation learning modules.
Therefore, the idea from the proposed model is similar to Li and Jurafsky (2015), because the sense selection is not one-hot but a distribution.
The novelty of this paper is limited because the model is relatively incremental.

From my perspective, the more influential contribution is that this paper points out the importance of evaluating sense selection capability, which is ignored by most prior work.
Therefore, I expect to see more detailed evaluation on the selection module of the model. 
Also, because the task of this paper is multi-sense embeddings, the traditional word similarity (without contexts) task seems unnecessary. 
Moreover, there is no error analysis about the result on the proposed contextual word sense selection task, which may shed more light on the strength and weakness of the model. 
Finally, I suggest the authors remove the word-level similarity task and try the recently released Word in Context (WiC) dataset, which is a binary classification task that determines whether the meaning of a word is different given two contexts.
It would be better to see that GASI performs well on this task given its better sense selection module.

Overall, the contribution is somewhat incremental and the evaluation/discussion should focus more on the sense selection module. 
Considering the issues mentioned above, I will expect better quality for an ICLR paper.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
