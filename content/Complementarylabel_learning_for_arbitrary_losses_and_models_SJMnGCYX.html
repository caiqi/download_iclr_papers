This only specifies one of the classes that the pattern does not belong to. The seminal paper on complementary-label learning proposed an unbiased estimator of the classification risk that can be computed only from complementarily labeled data. How- ever, it required a restrictive condition on the loss functions, making it impossible to use popular losses such as the softmax cross-entropy loss. Recently, another formulation with the softmax cross-entropy loss was proposed with consistency guarantee. However, this formulation does not explicitly involve a risk estimator. Thus model/hyper-parameter selection is not possible by cross-validation— we may need additional ordinarily labeled data for validation purposes, which is not available in the current setup. In this paper, we give a novel general framework of complementary-label learning, and derive an unbiased risk estimator for arbitrary losses and models. We further improve the risk estimator by non-negative correction and demonstrate its superiority through experiments.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">complementary labels, weak supervision</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">From now on, you can train ResNet and DenseNet, even if no class label given for training is correct!</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SkeJ7R_m6X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting setting, but problems with the original estimator and limited experimental evaluation weaken the claims</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMnG2C9YX&amp;noteId=SkeJ7R_m6X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1305 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">10 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1305 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Pros:
- The authors consider an interesting problem of learning from complementary labels
- They propose an approach that, assuming that the complementary label is selected uniformly at random, provides an unbiased estimate for any loss function, which is an improvement over the previous work. 
- Experiments show promising results for modifications of the proposed estimate

Cons:
- Having an unbiased estimate doesn't imply that its minimisation is a successful learning strategy. Indeed, the authors show that minimising their original estimate for the cross-entropy loss leads to overfitting. While the authors attribute this behaviour to the fact that the estimate can be negative, I believe the loss being negative is not problem per se (for example, substituting 0/1 loss with -100/-99 loss would not change the learning; similarly, this is not a problem for the losses considered in [Ishida'17]). I would rather attribute the problem to the fact that the proposed estimate is unbounded from below and there are no generalisation guarantees for it. Indeed, assuming there exists a training example that appears in the training set only once, with one complementary label, estimate (8) can be made arbitrary small by just training to predict probability 0 for the provided complementary label on that example ( and any non-zero probability for other classes). 
- to cope with the above mentioned problem, the authors propose two heuristic-based modifications of the estimate, which are potentially biased. This weakens the initial motivation for finding an unbiased estimate and shifts the focus towards the experimental evaluation
- one of the mentioned motivations for unbiased estimates - being able to perform model selection on complementary labeled validation set - is not illustrated in the experiments

Questions:
- I believe 1/(K-1) normalisation factor in (5) is not needed
- there seems to be a mistake in (9) (and its modifications later on) - I would expect either the subscript $j$ of the probability distribution in the last summand to be exchanged with $k$ in the loss, or a factor $\pi_j/\pi_k$ added
- also, I think there are some mistakes in subscripts in (11)
- what loss is the method from [Ishida'17] optimising in the experiments?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1gDnQhq3X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Clear paper on interesting setup, but claims are undermined by issues with first estimator + lack of motivation for assumptions</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMnG2C9YX&amp;noteId=B1gDnQhq3X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1305 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1305 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes an improved approach to the "complementary-label" form of weak supervision, in which a label that is *not* the true label is marked. Specifically, this paper proposes an unbiased estimator that accepts arbitrary loss functions and models. Noting that this proposed estimator can suffer from overfitting due to unbounded negative loss, a lower-bounded estimator is proposed. Experiments are then performed on several image classification datasets.

Pros:
- This paper addresses a creative form of weak supervision, proposed by prior work, in which labels that are *not* the true label are labeled, in a clear fashion.

- The first proposed estimator is unbiased, as shown by a proof, and accepts arbitrary losses, an improvement over prior approaches

- The overall presentation is clear and clean

Cons:
- One of the main claims of the paper is the proposal of an unbiased estimator. However, this estimator then does not seem to work well enough due to degenerate negative loss.  So then a modified version is proposed- which does not appear to be unbiased?  Either way, no assertion or proof of it being unbiased is given.  So then presumably this also reverses the claim of being able to cross-validate?  This seems like a major weakening of the paper's contributions

- Since the unbiased estimator does not appear to work well, two implementations of a corrected one are proposed, using heuristic approaches without explicit theoretical guarantees.  This shifts the burden to the experimental studies.  These are somewhat thorough, but not extremely so: for example, one set of hyperparameters were used for all of the methods?  This seems like it could implicitly handicap / favor some over others?

- The proposed estimator is based on the assumption that the probability of classes in the complement set (the set of labels other than the one marked as incorrect) is uniformly distributed (e.g. see beginning of Proof of thm 1).  However, this seems like a potentially naive assumption. Indeed, in the related work section, it is mentioned that work in 2018 already considered the case where this uniformity assumption does not hold.

- More broadly, but following from the above: The paper does not provide any real world examples, real or hypothetical, to give the reader an idea of whether the above uniformity assumption---or really any of these assumptions---are well-motivated or empirically justified.  At the bottom of page 3 in the related work, a concrete application used in prior work is mentioned---where crowd workers are shown single labels and vote Y/N, leading to a mix of standard (if Y) and complement-labeled (if N) data---however this mixed setting is not considered explicitly in this paper.  So, how is the reader supposed to get any idea of whether the assumed setup is motivated or justified?  The experiments do not provide this, because the complementary labels are synthetically generated according to the model assumed in the paper.  Additionally, it is briefly mentioned that collecting complementary labeled data is faster, but again no concrete examples are given to support this.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJedhpHq3X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Well written paper about an interesting problem.

- Clearly written and sound paper.
- Addresses interesting problem. 
- Improves existing methods used for this learning scenario.  

cons:

- The core contribution is a special case of previously published more general framework which is not cited in the paper.

It is clearly written paper with a good motivation. The major problem is that the core contribution, namely, the risk reformulation in Theorem 1 and the derived loss (6), are special cases of more general framework published in 
   Jesus Cid-Sueiro et al. Consistency of Losses for Learning from Weak Labels. ECML 2014.

The work of [Cid-Sueiro2014] proposes a general way how to construct losses for learning from weak labels. They require that the distribution of weak labels is a linear transformation of the true label distribution, i.e. the assumption (3) of the paper under review. According to [Cid-Sueiro2014], the loss on weak labels is constructed by $weak_loss = L*original_loss$, where $L$ is the left inversion of the "mixing matrix" $T$ in (3). [Cid-Sueiro2014] also shows that such weak loss is classification calibrated which implies statistical consistency of the method. 

Learning from complementary labels is a special case when the mixing matrix is $T=(E-I)/(K-1)$ (E is unitary matrix, I is matrix of ones, K is number of labels). In this case, the left inversion of $T$ is simply $L=- E*(K-1) + I$ and so the weak loss is $weak_loss=L*loss$ which corresponds to the loss (5) proposed in the paper under review (in fact, the loss (5) also adds a constant term (Y-2)/(Y-1) which however has no effect on the minimizer). 

The novel part of the paper is the non-negative risk estimator proposed in sec 3.3 and the online optimization methods addressed in sec 3.4. These extensions, although relatively straightforward, are empirically shown to significantly improve the results.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
