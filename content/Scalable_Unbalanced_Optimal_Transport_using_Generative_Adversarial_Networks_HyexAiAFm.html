The authors propose a novel approach to estimate unbalanced optimal transport between sampled measures that scales well in the dimension and in the number of samples. This formulation is based on a formulation of the entropy-transport problems of Liero et al. where the transport map, growth maps and Lagrangian multipliers are parameterized by neural networks. The effectiveness of the approach is shown on some tasks.

This is overall an ingenious contribution that opens a venue for interesting uses of optimal transport tools in learning problems (I can think for instance of transfer learning). As such I think the idea would deserve publication. However, I have some concerns with the way the theory is presented and with the lack of discussions on the theoretical limitations. Also, the theory seems a bit disconnected from the practical set up, and this should be emphasized. These concerns are detailed below. 

REMARKS ON SECTION 3

I think the theoretical part does not exhibit clearly the relationships with previous literature. The formulation proposed in the paper (6) is not new and consists in solving the optimal entropy-transport problem (2) on the set of product measures gamma that are deterministic, i.e. of the form
gamma(x,y) = (id x T)_# (xi mu) for some T:X -&gt; Y and xi : X -&gt; R_+ (here (id x T)(x) =(x,T(x)) )
It is classical in optimal transport to switch between convex/transport plan formulation (easier to study) to non-convex/transport map formulations (easier to interpret). (As a technical note, the support restriction in Lemma 3.2 is automatically satisfied for all feasible plans, for super-linear costs c_2=phi_1).

More precisely, since the authors introduce a reference measure lambda on a space Z (these objects are not motivated anywhere, but I guess are used to allow for multivalued transport maps?), they look for plans of the form
gamma(x,y) = (pi_x x T)_# (xi mu otime lambda) where (pi_x x T)(x,z) = (x,T(x,z) and "otime" yields product measures) (it is likely that similar connections could be made with the "static" formulations in Chizat et al.).

Introduced this way, the relationship to previous literature would have been clearer and the theoretical results are simple consequences of the results in Liero et al., who have characterized when optimal solutions of this form exist. Also this contradicts the remark that the authors make that it is better to model "directly mass variation" as their formulation is essentially equivalent.

The paragraph "Relation to Unbalanced OT" is, in my opinion, incomplete. The switch to non-convex formulation introduce many differences to convex approaches that are not mentioned: there is no guarantee that a minimizer can be found, there is a bias introduced by the architecture of the neural network, ... Actually, it is this bias that make the formulation useful in high dimension since it is know that optimal transport suffers from the curse of dimensionality (thus it would be useless to try to solve it exactly in high dimension). I suggest to improve this discussion.

OTHER REMARKS
A small remark: lemma 3.1 is the convex conjugate formula for the phi-divergence in the first argument. I suggest to call it this way to help the reader connect with concepts he or she already knows. Its rigorous proof (with measurability issues properly dealt with) can be found, for instance, in Liero et al. Theorem 2.7. It follows that the central objective (8) is a Lagrangian saddle-point formulation of the problem of Liero et al., where transport plans, scalings and Lagrange multipliers are parameterized by neural networks. I generally think it is best to make the link with previous work as simple as possible.

Also, Appendix C lacks details to understand precisely how the experiments where done. It is written :
"In practice, [the correct output range] can be enforced by parameterizing f using a neural network with a final layer that maps to the correct range. In practice, we also found that employing a Lipschitz penalty on f stabilizes training."
This triggers two remarks: 
- (i) how precisely is the correct range enforced? This should be stated.
- (ii) a Lipschitz penalty on f yields a class of functions which is very unlikely to have the properties of Lemma 3.1 ; in fact, this amounts to replacing the last term in (6) by a sort of "bounded Lipschitz" distance which has very different property from a f-divergence. This makes the theory of section 3 a bit disconnected from the practice of section 4.

The authors introduce first the now standard Kantorovich-like formulation, which considers a coupling whose marginals are penalized to look like the two target measures. The authors introduce a second formulation in (2), somewhat a Kantorovich/Monge hybrid that involves a "random" Monge map where the target point T(x) of a point x now depends also on an additional random variable z, to desribe T(x,z). The authors also consider a local mass creation term (\xi) to weight the initial measure \mu.

The authors emphasize the interest of the 2nd formulation, which, much like the original Monge problem, has an intractable push-forward constraint. This formulation is similar to recent work on Wasserstein Autoencoders (to which is added the scaling parameter). As with WAE, this constraint is relaxed to penalize the deviation between the "random" push-forward and the desired marginal. 

The authors show then that the resulting problem, which involves a transportation cost integrated both on the random variable z and on the input domain x, weighted by xi + a simple penalization for xi + a divergence penalizing the deviation between push-forward and desired marginal, can be optimized altogether by using three NN: 1 for the parameterization of T, 1 for the parameterization of \xi, and one to optimize using a function f a variational bound on the divergence. 2 gradient descents (T,\xi), 1 gradient ascent (f, variational bound).

The authors then make a link between that penalize formulation and something that resembles unbalanced transport (I say resembles because there is some assymetry, and that the type of couplings is restricted). Finally the authors show that by letting increase the penalty in front of the divergence in (6) they recover something that looks like the solution of (2).

For the sake of completeness, the authors provide in the appendix an implementation of a simple dual ascent scheme to approximate unbalanced OT inspired from previous work by Seguy'17, and show that, unlike that work, their implicit parameterization of the scaling factor \xi can help, and illustrate this numerically.

I give credit to the authors for addressing a new problem and providing an algorithmic formulation to do so. That algorithm is itself recovered from an alternative formulation of unbalanced OT, and is therefore interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, I have found the presentation rushed. I really believe the paper would deserve an extensive re-write. Everything is fairly clear until Section 3. Then, the authors introduce their main contribution.  Basically the section tries to prove two things at the same time, without really completing its job. One is to prove that "dualizing" the scaling+ random push-forward equality constraint is ok if one uses big enough regularizers (intuitive), the other that this scaled + random push-forward formulation is closely related to W_{ub}. This is less clear to me (see below). 

The experiments are underwhelming. For faces they happen in latent spaces, and therefore one recovers transport between latent spaces later re-visualized through a decoder. For digits, all is fairly simple. They do not clearly mention whether this alternative UOT approach approximates UOT at all. Despite the title, there's no generation. Therefore my grade is really split between a 5 and a 6.

minor comments and questions:

- Is the reference to a local scaling (\xi) for unbalanced transport entirely new? your paper is not clear on that, and it seems to me this idea already appears in the OT literature.

- I do not understand the connexion you make with GANs. In what sense can you interpret any of your networks as generators? To me it just feels like a simultaneous optimization of various networks, yet without a clear generative purpose. Technically there may be several similarities (as we optimize on networks), but I am not sure this justifies referencing GANs in the title. Additionally, and almost mechanically, putting GAN in your paper, the reader will expect some generation results..

- Numerical benchmarks: Is the technique you propose supposed to approximate the optimal value of Unbalanced OT at all? If yes, is there a way you could compare yourselves with Chizat's approach?

- Somewhere in Lemma 3.2 the fact that you had to use an alternative definition \tilde{W} (by restricting the class of couplings) is not really clarified to the reader. Qualitatively, what does it mean that you restrict the class of couplings to have the same support as \mu? In which situations would \tilde{W} be very different from W_{ub} ? (which, if I understand correctly, only appears in (2) but not elsewhere in the paper?)

- I think it would help for the simple sake of readability to add integration domains under your \int symbols.

- T is used as a subset in Lemma 3.1, while it is used after and before as a map of (x,z)

- T(x,z) looks intuitively like a noisy encoder as in Wasserstein AEs (with, of course, the addition of your term \xi). Could you elaborate?

- I have scanned the paper but did not see how you set lambda.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BklmCVWU3X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>good effort for scalable unbalanced OT, theoretical aspect might be problematic </a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyexAiA5Fm&amp;noteId=BklmCVWU3X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper861 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">31 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper861 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary: 

The paper introduces a static formulation for unbalanced optimal transport by learning simultaneously a transport map T and scaling factor xi .

Some theory is given to relate this formulation to unbalanced transport metrics such as Wasserstein Fisher Rao metrics  for e.g. Chizat et al 2018.  

The paper proposes to  relax the constraint in the proposed static formulation using a divergence.  furthermore using a bound on the divergence , the final discrepancy proposed  is written as a min max problem between the witness function f of the divergence and the transport map T , and scaling factor xi. 

An algorithm is given to find the optimal map T as a generator in GAN and to learn the scaling factor  and the witness function of the divergence with a neural network paramterization , the whole optimized with stochastic gradient. 

Small experimentation on image to image transportation with unbalance in the classes is given and show how the scaling factor behaves wrt to this kind of unbalance. 


Novelty and  Originality:

The paper claims that there are no known static formulations known with a scaling factor and a transport map learned simultaneously. We refer the authors to Unbalanced optimal Transport: Geometry and Kantrovich Formulation Chizat et al 2015. In page 19 in this paper Equation 2.33 a similar formulation to Equation 4 in this paper is given. (Note that phi corresponds to T and lambda to xi). This is known as the monge formulation of unbalanced optimal transport. The main difference is that the authors here introduce a stochastic map T and an additional probabilty space Z. Assuming that the mapping is deterministic those two formulations are equivalent. 

Correctness: 

The metric defined in this paper can be written as follow and corresponds to a generalization of the monge formulation in chizat 2015 :
L(mu,nu)= inf_{T, xi}  int   c_1(x,T_x(z) ) xi(x) lambda(z) dmu(x)  + int c_2(x_i(x)) dmu(x)
                        		 s.t T_# (xi mu)=nu
In order to get a kantorovich formulation out of this chizat et al 2015 defines semi couplings and the formulation is given in Equations 3.1 page 20. 

This paper proposes to relax  T_# (xi mu)=nu with D_psi (xi \mu, \nu) and hence proposes to use:

L(mu,nu)= inf_{T, xi} int   c_1(x,T_x(z) ) xi(x) lambda(z) dmu(x)  + int c_2(x_i(x)) dmu(x)+  D_psi (xi \mu, \nu)

Lemma 3.2 of the paper claims that the formulation above corresponds to the Kantrovich formulation of unbalanced transport. I doubt the correctness of this:

Inspecting the proof of Lemma 3.2 L \geq W seems correct to me, but it is unclear what is going on in the proof of the other direction? The existence of T_x is not well supported by rigorous proof or citation? Where does xi come from in the third line of the equalities in the end of page 14? I donâ€™t follow the equalities written at the end of page 14. 

Another concern is the space Z, how does the metric depend on this space? should there be an inf on all Z?

Other comments:

- Appendix A is good wish you baselined your experiments with those algorithms. 

- The experiments donâ€™t show any benefit for learning the scaling factor, are there any applications in biology that would make a better case for this method?

- What was the architecture used to model T, xi, and f?

- Improved training dynamics in the appendix, it seems you are ignoring the weighting while optimizing on theta? than how would the weighing be beneficial ?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
