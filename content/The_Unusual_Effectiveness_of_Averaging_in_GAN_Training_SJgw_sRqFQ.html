Moving Average (MA) computes the time-average of parameters, whereas Exponential Moving Average (EMA) computes an exponentially discounted sum. Whilst MA is known to lead to convergence in bilinear settings, we provide the first to our knowledge theoretical arguments in support of EMA. We show that EMA converges to limit cycles around the equilibrium with vanishing amplitude as the discount parameter approaches one. We establish experimentally that both techniques are strikingly effective in the non convex-concave GAN setting as well. Both improve inception and FID scores on different architectures and for different GAN objectives. We provide comprehensive experimental results across a range of datasets -- mixture of Gaussians, CIFAR-10, STL-10, CelebA and ImageNet -- to demonstrate its effectiveness. We achieve state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 and produce clean CelebA face images.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Moving Average, Exponential Moving Average, Convergence, Limit Cycles</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">6 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BkxOZLU93Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>novelty would be low</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgw_sRqFQ&amp;noteId=BkxOZLU93Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper361 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper361 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper evaluates two moving average strategies for GAN optimization. Since exact theoretical analysis is difficult for this case, some informal consideration are provided for explanation of performance gain. Experiments confirmed high performance of averaging.

The basic idea seems to be reasonable. Moving average-based strategy would stabilize optimization process. 

The obvious weakness of the paper is technical novelty. Although the experimental improvement is confirmed, I would have to say just comparing two known averaging methods would not have strong novelty.

Section 3.1 would be most important part of the paper, but it only mentions quite general tendency of averaging (seems not specific to GAN).</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SklOVdg5hQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An interesting experimental paper exploring the effect of parameter averaging in GANs</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgw_sRqFQ&amp;noteId=SklOVdg5hQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper361 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper361 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper tries to adapt the concept of averaging, well known is the game literature, to GAN training. In a simple min-max example the iterates obtained by gradient method do not converge to the equilibrium of the game but their average does. This work first provides intuitions on the potential benefits of exponential moving average (EMA) on a simple illustrative example and explore the effect of averaging on GAN.

In think that the approach of this paper is interesting. I particularly like the experiments on Celeb-A (Fig 6 and 7) that seem to show that the averaged iterates change more smoothly (with respect to the attributes of the faces) during the training procedure. Nevertheless, I have some concerns about the claims of the paper and the experimental process.

I'm surprised by the values of the inception score provided in Table 2 which do not seem to correlate with the sample quality in Fig. 3. Why did not you use the standard implementation of the inception score provided in Salimans et al. [2016]'s paper ?

I think that the effectiveness of EMA over uniform averaging is a bit overclaimed. 
- From a theoretical point of view uniform averaging works better (at least in your example in 3.1): If you (uniformly) average the periodic orbit you get a converging iterate. Moreover, concerning to this toy example, note that this continuous analysis has been already introduced in [Goodfellow et al., 2016] and the Hamiltonian interpretation has been already provided in [Balduzzi et al. 2018].
However I think that the intuition on the vanishing magnitude of the oscillation provided by EMA is interesting.
- The continuous dynamics is actually different from the discrete one, I think that an analysis on the discrete case that is used in practice might be more insightful.
- The comparison with uniform averaging is not fair in the sense that uniform averaging has no hyperparameter to tune: In figure 6 uniform averaging performs better than a not well tuned EMA. A fair comparison would be for instance to propose a parametrized online averaging $\theta_{MA}^t = \frac{t - \alpha}{t} \theta_{MA}^{t-1} + \frac{\alpha}{t} \theta_t$ and to tune it the same way $\beta$ is tuned in EMA.

Minor comments: 
- In the introduction "gradient vector fields of the game may not be conservative (Mescheder et al. 2017)" and the related work "Mescheder et al. (2017) states that a reason for non-convergence is the non-conservative gradient
vector of the players.": the notion of conservative vs. non-conservative vector field is never mentioned in [Mescheder et al. 2017]. I think you are actually referring to the blog post on that paper <a href="https://www.inference.vc/my-notes-on-the-numerics-of-gans/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.inference.vc/my-notes-on-the-numerics-of-gans/</a> .
- In the Related work "can not"
- "In fact, it has recently been established that the smooth (continuous-time) analogues of first order methods such as online gradient descent (follow-the-regularized leader) in bilinear zero-sum games are recurrent (i.e. effectively periodic)
with trajectories cycling back into themselves. " can you provide a citation ?
- Some published papers are refereed as arxiv paper ( for instance (Mescheder et al. 2017) and (Mescheder et al. 2018)), you should cite the published version.

While reading the submission, the intuitively given explanations for using EMA (cycling, mainly) seem reasonable. However, I do not think there is sufficient understanding of the (non-)convergence behavior in real-world GAN settings, and this submission does not contribute much to it.
The theoretical underpinnings in Section 3.1 are quite thin, and focus on describing one particular example of a bilinear saddle problem, which is quite far from a typical GAN, as used e.g. in computer vision problems. Although interesting to read, I would not draw any wider-reaching conclusions from this carefully constructed example.

Instead, the submission serves mainly as an experimental study on why EMA works better in some of the tested cases than MA/None. Main quantitative measures are the often-used IS and FID. It is clear from both the provided quantitative values as well as the provided qualitative images that either averaging method is likely better then no averaging.

Unfortunately, IS and FID contradict each other somewhat for EMA vs. MA in Table 2, which is attributed to IS being [more] flawed [than FID]. Neither measure is flawless, however, which diminshes the usefulness of the numeric results somewhat. Well designed human studies may be complicated to set up and costly to conduct, but these could demonstrate additional confirmation of the usefulness of the proposed method.

EMA introduces an additional hyperparameter, beta, which is only discussed very briefly, and only in the context of qualitative results. I missed a more thorough discussion of the impact of beta.

Overall, the submission makes an interesting proposition (usage of EMA during GAN training), but falls short in convincing me that this is a useful thing to do in broader contexts. Overall originality is minor; projected significance is minor to medium.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJlhxSOxcm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>suggestion</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgw_sRqFQ&amp;noteId=HJlhxSOxcm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures"><a href="/profile?id=~Hello_Kitty2" class="profile-link">Hello Kitty</a></span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper361 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">This work is closely related to the following paper:
