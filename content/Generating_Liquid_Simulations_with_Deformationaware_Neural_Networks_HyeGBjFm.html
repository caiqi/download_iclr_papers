Our method specifically targets the space-time representation of physical surfaces from liquid simulations. Liquids exhibit highly complex, non-linear behavior under changing simulation conditions such as different initial conditions. Our algorithm captures these complex phenomena in two stages: a first neural network computes a weighting function for a set of pre-computed deformations, while a second network directly generates a deformation field for refining the surface. Key for successful training runs in this setting is a suitable loss function that encodes the effect of the deformations, and a robust calculation of the corresponding gradients. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we showcase our method with several complex examples of flowing liquids with topology changes. Our representation makes it possible to rapidly generate the desired implicit surfaces. We have implemented a mobile application to demonstrate that real-time interactions with complex liquid effects are possible with our approach.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Learning weighting and deformations of space-time data sets for highly efficient approximations of liquid behavior.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">deformation learning, spatial transformer networks, fluid simulation</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">6 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rkeUwxkin7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A Good Attempt towards Applying Deep Learning for Physical Simulation</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyeGBj09Fm&amp;noteId=rkeUwxkin7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper70 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper70 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper introduces a deep learning approach for physical simulation. The approach combines two networks for synthesizing 4D data that represents 3D physical simulations. Here the first network outputs an initial guess, and the second network adds details. The first network utilizes a set of precomputed deformations, while the weights can be set to generate different output shapes. The precomputed deformations are applied in a recurrent manner. The second network is a variant of STN. 

The results are impressive from the perspective of the current abilities of deep neural networks. The synthesized simulations are not physically accurate, but with certain visual realism. Experimental results are sufficient. 

However, it is also necessarily to add more intuitions to the current approach. First, it would be good to discuss why the current network design is desired. For example, when designing the first network, can we also design another neural network that applies the deformation backwards and enforce some consistency to improve the results? Also, many simulations use adaptive sampling (high-resolution near the surface and low-residual in the interior). Can we use an adaptive grid-structure (say Octree) to increase the resolution? 

Also, is there a simple setting so that the current network design generates accurate results. If not, would increase the number of pre-computed deformations improve the approximation. If so, what would be the optimal basis for $u_i$? What is the tradeoff between using more basis for the first network and increasing the complexity of the second network?

For visualization, it would also good to show the 3D grid.

Overall, it is good paper to see at ICLR.

- Regarding “... applying the deformation backwards to enforce consistency …”:

This is an interesting direction, checking consistency between forward and backward steps could yield an estimate of, e.g., loss of momentum. However, as a first additional constraint, we would target divergence freeness, i.e., conservation of mass.

- Regarding “... adaptive grid-structure (say Octree) to increase the resolution …“:

That is a good direction. A focus on the surface would be particularly useful for liquids, and we believe our approach for learning deformations would transfer nicely to adaptive representations like octrees. However, we were not able to try this up to now.

- Regarding “... increase the number of pre-computed deformations to improve the approximation ...”:

Yes, it would improve the approximation quality. We increased the deformations in one of the tests and obtained correspondingly better results. The size of the basis is a compromise between memory/pre-computing time and quality. In our case, we have reduced the basis as much as possible, taking into account the degrees of freedom of interaction. If the reviewers wish, we could add the example with additional deformations to our submission.

Given densely registered 4D implicit surfaces (volumes over time) for a structured scene, a neural-network based model is used to interpolate simulations for novel scene conditions (e.g. position and size of dropped water ball). The interpolation model composes two components -- given these conditions, it first regresses weights combining a set of precomputed deformation fields, and then a second model regresses dense volumetric deformation corrections -- these are helpful as some events are not easily modeled with a set of basis deformations. 

I found the paper hard to read at first, since the paper is heavy on terminology, only really understood what is going on when I went through the examples in the appendix, which are helpful and then on a second read the content was clear and appears technically correct. I would advise considering defining in more detail early the problem setup (e.g. Fig 13 was helpful), explain some of the variables in context. 

This is primarily an application paper on simulating liquids in controlled scenes using nets and appears novel in that narrow domain. The specific way deformations are composed -- using v_inv to backwards correct basis deformations, following up the mixing of those with a correction model -- is intuitive and is also something I see for the first time. 

The experimental results are sufficient for simulating liquids/smoke, except I would like to also see a comparison to using deformation field network only, without its predecessor. This was done for Fig 6, but would be nice to also see it numerically in ablation in Fig. 4. Another useful experiment would be to vary the number of bases and/or the resolution of the deformation correction network and see the effects. 

More importantly, it would be very helpful is to try this approach for modeling deforming object and body shapes for which there are many datasets (e.g. Shapenet). Right now the implicit surface deformation model is only tested on liquids examples, which limits the impact to that specialist domain -- it's a bit more of a SIGGRAPH type of paper than ICLR. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BklwYtxlCm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Thanks for your review.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyeGBj09Fm&amp;noteId=BklwYtxlCm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper70 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">19 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper70 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thank you for the helpful feedback.

- Regarding “... would be nice to also see it numerically as ablation in Fig. 4 …”:

Actually, our examples contain an ablation study, although we agree that it could be more clearly presented as such. There is an entry for a version without parameter learning in Fig. 4, which we refer to as ‘flat’, indicating that there is only a as-simple-as possible initial shape, and no pre-computed deformation. Thus, an ablation study is given for the drop setup with the versions: 1) initial error, 2) parameter learning only without deformation learning, 3) deformation learning only (‘flat’ example), 4) full method. We will revise our document accordingly to clarify this.

- Regarding “...  trying this approach for modeling deforming object and body shapes … “:

This would be very interesting. In our case, we have focused on fluid simulations because they are already a difficult problem, but another test case would help to prove the generalizability of our approach.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BylpiCech7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Good applied paper appropriate for a workshop</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyeGBj09Fm&amp;noteId=BylpiCech7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper70 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper70 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper presents a coupled deep learning approach for generating realistic liquid simulation data that can be useful for real-time decision support applications. While this is a good applied paper with a large variety of experimental results, there is a significant lack of novelty from a machine learning perspective. 

1. The primary novelty here is in the problem formulation (e.g., defining cost function etc.) where two networks are used, one for learning appropriate deformation parameters and the other to generate the actual liquid shapes. This is an interesting idea to generate the required training data and build a generalizable model. 

2. But based on my understanding, this does not really explicitly incorporate the physical laws within the learning model and can't guarantee that the generated data would obey the physical laws and invariances. So, this is closer to a graphics approach and deep learning has been used before extensively in a similar manner for shape generation, shape transformation etc.    

3. In terms of practical applications, to the best of my knowledge there are sophisticated physics-based and graphics based approaches that perform very fast fluid simulations. So, the authors need to provide accuracy and computation cost/time comparisons with such methods to establish the benefits of using a deep learning based surrogate model.   </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1l7TYggCX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Thanks for your review.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyeGBj09Fm&amp;noteId=S1l7TYggCX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper70 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">19 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper70 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thank you for the valuable comments which are addressed as follows.

“...does not really explicitly incorporate the physical laws within the learning model…”

We agree, this would be an interesting direction for future work. We have focused on a more generic method that could also applied to other areas with different or no physical constraints. And for all such extensions it is important to establish how well the core of the method works, which we have focus on in our submission.

“...sophisticated physics-based and graphics based approaches that perform very fast fluid simulations…”

Yes, this is a very good point, and we believe the performance of our trained models is the main strength of our method. We have a variety of solvers available in our group, and we have long standing experience with high-performance of fluid solvers. We can confidently say that no other method currently comes close in terms of performance. Our cell phone implementation is a good indicator of this: despite being published in early 2017, no other 3D liquid simulations is available on Android so far (to the best of our knowledge).

“... provide accuracy and computation cost/time comparisons with such methods …”

As we mention in the paper, our method is currently more than three orders of magnitude faster than a reference Eulerian CPU-based solver. We’d be happy to add a comparison where the CPU solver accuracy is reduced to levels matching our deformation learning algorithm (cf. Fig. 4). We have previously also performed tests with SPH-based solvers on Android smartphones. However, despite GPU-optimizations we were only able to achieve simulations with less than 10k particles, which led to smooth simulations with very few details. Thus, for a given computational budget, neither Lagrangian nor Eulerian simulations methods can currently give a quality similar to our deep learning model.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
