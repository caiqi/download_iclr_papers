However, general NLP models cannot emerge within a paradigm that focuses on the particularities of a single metric, dataset, and task.
We introduce the Natural Language Decathlon (decaNLP), a challenge that spans ten tasks:
question answering, machine translation, summarization, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, semantic role labeling, relation extraction, goal-oriented dialogue, semantic parsing, and commonsense pronoun resolution.
We cast all tasks as question answering over a context.
Furthermore, we present a new multitask question answering network (MQAN) that jointly learns all tasks in decaNLP without any task-specific modules or parameters more effectively than sequence-to-sequence and reading comprehension baselines.
MQAN shows improvements in transfer learning for machine translation and named entity recognition, domain adaptation for sentiment analysis and natural language inference, and zero-shot capabilities for text classification.
We demonstrate that the MQAN's multi-pointer-generator decoder is key to this success and that performance further improves with an anti-curriculum training strategy.
Though designed for decaNLP, MQAN also achieves state of the art results on the WikiSQL semantic parsing task in the single-task setting. 
We also release code for procuring and processing data, training and evaluating models, and reproducing all experiments for decaNLP.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">multitask learning, natural language processing, question answering, machine translation, relation extraction, semantic parsing, commensense reasoning, summarization, entailment, sentiment, dialog</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We introduce a multitask learning challenge that spans ten natural language processing tasks and propose a new model that jointly learns them. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">5 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1xIPcoqh7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A good example to treat different NLP problems as Q&amp;A and trained together.

All these tasks are trained together. 

If the goal is to achieve general AI, the paper gives a good starting point. One technical novelty is the deep learning architecture for this general Q&amp;A problem including the multi-pointer-generator. The paper presents an example of how to do a multi-task learning for 10 different tasks. It raises a very challenging problem or in some way release a new dataset.

If our goal is to optimize a single task, the usefulness of the method proposed by the paper is questionable. 
As we know, multi-task learning works well if some important knowledge shared by different tasks can be learned and leveraged. From table 2, we see for many problems, the results of the single task training are better than the multi-task training, meaning that other tasks can't really help at least under this framework. This makes me doubt if this multi-task learning is useful if our goal is to optimize the performance of a single task. This general model also sacrifices some important prior knowledge of an individual task. For example, for the Squad, the prior that the answer is a continuous span. Ideally, the prior knowledge should be leveraged.

The modeling is building on pre-existing qa models but has some original aspects that were augmented to accommodate the various tasks.  The decaNLP framework could be a useful benchmark for other nlp researchers.  

Experiments indicate that the multi-task set-up does worse on average than the single-task set-up.  I wish there was more analysis on why multi-task setups are helpful in some tasks and not others.  With a bit more fine-grained analysis, the experiments and framework in this paper could be very beneficial towards other researchers who want to experiment with multi-task learning or who want to use the decaNLP framework as a benchmark.

I also found the adaptation to new tasks and zero-shot experiments very interesting but the set-up was not described very concretely: 
  -in the transfer learning section, I hope the writers will elaborate on whether the performance gain is coming from the model being pretrained on a multi-task objective or if there would still be performance gain by pretraining a model on only one of those tasks.  For example, would a model pre-trained solely on IWSLT see the same performance gain when transferred to English-&gt;Czech as in Figure 4? Or is it actually the multi-task training that is causing the improvement in transfer learning? 
  -Can you please add more detail about the setup for replacing +/- with happy/angry or supportive/unsupportive? What were the (empirical) results of that experiment?

I think the paper doesn’t quite stand on its own without the appendix, which is a major weakness in terms of clarity.  The related work, for example, should really be included in the main body of the paper.  I also recommend that more of the original insights (such as the experimentation with curriculum learning) should be included in the body of the text to count towards original contributions.  

As a suggestion, the authors may be able to condense the discussion of the 10 tasks in order to make more room in the main text for a related work section plus more of their motivations and experimental results.  If necessary, the main paper *can* exceed 8 pages and still fit ICLR guidelines.

Very minor detail: I noticed some inconsistency in the bibliography regarding full names vs. first initials only.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: Clear rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1lGsQAShm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Misguided and overcrowded</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1lfHhR9tm&amp;noteId=S1lGsQAShm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1522 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">30 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1522 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">I appreciate the work that went into creating this paper, but I'm afraid I see little justification for accepting it.  I have three major complaints with this paper:                                                                         
                                                                                                     
1. I think the framing of decaNLP presented in this paper does more harm than good, because it perpetuates a misguided view of question answering.
                                                                                                     
Question answering is not a unified phenomenon.  There is no such thing as "general question answering", not even for humans.  Consider "What is 2 + 3?", "What's the terminal velocity of a rain drop?", and "What is the meaning of life?"  All of these questions require very different systems to answer, and trying to pretend they are the same doesn't help anyone solve any problems.
                                                                                                     
Question answering is a _format_ for studying particular phenomena.  Sometimes it is useful to pose a task as QA, and sometimes it is not.  QA is not a useful format for studying problems when you only have a single question (like "what is the sentiment?" or "what is the translation?"), and there is no hope of transfer from a related task.  Posing translation or classification as QA serves no useful purpose and gives people the wrong impression about question answering as a format for studying problems.

We have plenty of work that studies multiple datasets at a time (including in the context of semi-supervised / transfer learning), without doing this misguided framing of all of them as QA (see, e.g., the ELMo and BERT papers, which evaluated on many separate tasks).  I don't see any compelling justification for setting things up this way.
                                                                                                     
2. One of the main claims of this paper is transfer from one task to another by posing them all as question answering.  There is nothing new in the transfer results that were presented here, however.  For QA-SRL / QA-ZRE, transfer from SQuAD / other QA tasks has already been shown by Luheng He (<a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/N18-2089)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://aclweb.org/anthology/N18-2089)</a> and Omer Levy (that was the whole point of the QA-ZRE paper), so this is merely reproducing that result (without mentioning that they did it first).  For all other tasks, performance drops when you try to train all tasks together, sometimes significantly (as in translation, unsurprisingly).  For the Czech task, fine tuning a pre-trained model has already been shown to help.  Transfer from MNLI to SNLI is known already and not surprising - one of the main points of MNLI was domain transfer, so obviously this has been studied before.  The claims about transfer to new classification tasks are misleading, as you really have the _same_ classification task, you've just arbitrarily changed how you're encoding the class label.  It _might_ be the case that you still get transfer if you actually switch to a related classification task, but you haven't examined that case.
                                                                                                     
3. This paper tries to put three separate ideas into a single conference paper, and all three ideas suffer as a result, because there is not enough space to do any of them justice.  Giving 15 pages of appendix for an 8 page paper, where some of the main content of the paper is pushed to the appendix, is egregious.  Putting your work in the context of related work is not something that should be pushed into an appendix, and we should not encourage this behavior.
                                                                                                     
The three ideas here seem to me to be (1) decaNLP, (2) the model architecture of MQAN, (3) transfer results.  Any of these three could have been a single conference paper, had it been done well.  As it stands, decaNLP isn't described or motivated well enough, and there isn't any space left in the paper to address my severe criticisms of it in my first point.  Perhaps if you had dedicated the paper to decaNLP, you could have given arguments that the framing is worthwhile, and described the tasks and their setup as QA sufficiently (as it is, I don't see any description anywhere of how the context is constructed for WikiSQL; did I miss it somewhere?).  For MQAN, there's more than a page of the core new architecture that's pushed into the appendix.  And for the transfer results, there is very little comparison to other transfer methods (e.g., ELMo, CoVe), or any deep analysis of what's going on - as I mentioned above, basically all of the results presented are just confirming what has already been done elsewhere.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: Clear rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJe-iuo5qm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Please respect prior work</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1lfHhR9tm&amp;noteId=HJe-iuo5qm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">10 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1522 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">The related work section should not be buried in Appendix B on page 17.

From the text of the main paper, a reader would have no indication that multi-task NLP has been around for 10+ years, and that the main novelty here is the particular selection of tasks and aggregating performance across those tasks as a benchmark. The authors should be more clear and honest about what their contribution is.

As an example, I'll point to [1], a well known paper (2.7k cites) from ICML 2008, titled "A Unified Architecture for Natural Language Processing: Deep Neural Networks with Multitask Learning".
