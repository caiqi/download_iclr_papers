The factor transfer is one of the knowledge transfer methods that improves the performance of a student network with a strong teacher network. It transfers the knowledge of a teacher in the feature map level using high-capacity teacher network, and our training algorithm FEED is an extension of it. FEED aims to transfer ensemble knowledge, using either multiple teachers in parallel or multiple training sequences. Adapting the peer-teaching framework, we introduce a couple of training algorithms that transfer ensemble knowledge to the student at the feature map level, both of which help the student network find more generalized solutions in the parameter space. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show that our method, FEED, has clear performance enhancements,without introducing any additional parameters or computations at test time.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Knowledge Distillation, Ensemble Effect, Knowledge Transfer</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJgiuVx-6Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Potentially lack of true novelty</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJxYEsAqY7&amp;noteId=rJgiuVx-6Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper18 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">08 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper18 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">I do not necessarily see something wrong with the paper, but I'm not convinced of the significance (or sufficient novelty) of the approach. 

The way I understand it, a translator is added on top of the top layer of the student, which is nothing but a few conv layers that project the output to potentially the size of the teacher (by the way, why do you need both a paraphraser and translator, rather than making the translator always project to the size of the teacher which basically will do the same thing !? )
And then a distance is minimized between the translated value of the students and the teacher output layer. The distance is somewhat similar to L2 (though the norm is removed from the features -- which probably helps with learning in terms of gradient norm). 

Comparing with normal distillation I'm not sure how significant the improvement is. And technically this is just a distance metric between the output of the student and teacher. Sure it is a more involved distance metric, however it is in the spirit of what the distillation work is all about and I do not see this as being fundamentally different, or at least not different enough for an ICLR paper.

Some of the choices seem arbitrary to me (e.g. using both translator and paraphraser). Does the translator need to be non-linear? Could it be linear? What is this mapping doing (e.g. when teacher and student have the same size) ? Is it just finding a rotation of the features? Is it doing something fundamentally more interesting? 

Why this particular distance metric between the translated features? Why not just L2? 

In the end I'm not sure the work as is, is ready for ICLR.

Reading it made me rather confused. 

Good things:
- The main idea is sensible, though distilling into the same architecture (sFEED) is not that novel. I think the pFEED is probably the more novel part.
- The numerical results are quite good.
- It's a fairly simple method. If others reproduced these results, I think it would be useful.

Problems:
- Some parts of the paper are written in a way that makes the reader confused about what this paper is about. For example the first paragraph. Some motivations I just did not understand.
- Some parts of the paper are repeating itself. For example "introduction" and "related works". The section on related work also includes some quite unrelated papers.
- The references in the paper are often pointing to work that came much later than the original idea or some pretty random recent papers. For example the idea of model compression (or knowledge distillation) is much older than Hinton et al. I believe it was first proposed by Bucila et al. [1] (which the authors mention later as if knowledge distillation and model compression were very different ideas), it definitely doesn't come from Kim et al. (2018). Learning from intermediate representations of the network is at least as old as Romero et al. [2]. Compression into a network of the same architecture is definitely older than Furnarello et al. (2018). It was done, for example, by Geras et al. [3]. The paper also cites Goodfellow et al. (2016) in some pretty random contexts. I don't want to be too petty about references, but unfortunately, this paper is just below a threshold that I would still find acceptable in this respect.
- The comparison in Table 6 would make more sense if the same architectures would be clearly compared. As it is, it is difficult to be certain where the improvement is coming from and how it actually compares to different methods.

Firstly, it would be a good idea to cite <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6184," target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6184,</a> it precedes knowledge distillation and is basically the same thing minus a temperature parameter and a catchy name.

The paper could do with some further grammar/spell checks.

It isn't clear to me where the novelty lies in this work. Sequential-FEED appears to be identical to BANs (https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04770) with an additional non-linear transformation on the network outputs as in https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04977. Parallel-FEED is just an ensemble of teachers; please correct me if I'm wrong.

The experimental results aren't convincing. There aren't any fair comparisons. For instance, in table 6 a WRN-28-10(sFEED) after 5 whole training iterations is compared to a WRN-28-1(BAN) after 1. It would be good to run BAN for as many iterations. A comparison to attention transfer (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03928) would be ideal for the ImageNet experiments. Furthermore, if one isn't interested in compression, then Table 4 indicates that an ensemble is largely preferable.

This work would benefit from a CIFAR-10 experiment as it's so widely used (interestingly, BANs perform poorly on CIFAR-10), also a task that isn't image classification would be helpful to get a feel of how the method generalizes.

In summary I believe this paper should be rejected, as the method isn't very novel, and the experimental merits are unclear.

Pros:
- Simple method
- Largely written with clarity

Cons:
- Method is not very novel
- No compared thoroughly enough to other work</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
