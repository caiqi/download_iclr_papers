After a trained model is obtained, one can sample the Generator in various forms for exploration and understanding, such as interpolating between two samples, sampling in the vicinity of a sample or exploring differences between a pair of samples applied to a third sample. However, the latent space operations commonly used in the literature so far induce a distribution mismatch between the resulting outputs and the prior distribution the model was trained on. Previous works have attempted to reduce this mismatch with heuristic modification to the operations or by changing the latent distribution and re-training models. In this paper, we propose a framework for modifying the latent space operations such that the distribution mismatch is fully eliminated. Our approach is based on optimal transport maps, which adapt the latent space operations such that they fully match the prior distribution, while minimally modifying the original operation. Our matched operations are readily obtained for the commonly used operations and distributions and require no adjustment to the training procedure.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">generative models, optimal transport, distribution preserving operations</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We propose a framework for modifying the latent space operations such that the distribution mismatch between the resulting outputs and the prior distribution the generative model was trained on is fully eliminated.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SklDZf7C2Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A neat and sound interpolation modification approach but more experiments are needed</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BklCusRct7&amp;noteId=SklDZf7C2Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper399 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper399 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span><a class="note_content_pdf item" href="/revisions?id=SklDZf7C2Q" target="_blank">Show Revisions</a></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Noticing that widely used latent code interpolations for exploring the generative capabilities of VAEs and GANs have distribution mismatch problems, this paper proposes to utilize monotone transport map to exactly eliminate the distribution mismatch between modified interpolated codes and a prior distribution, assuming I.I.D. code components and a L1 code distance. More precisely, a transformation of the latent space operation is learnt with the objective that the distribution of the transformed variable match the prior distribution used in training the generative models. Optimal transport is used as a measure to minimize the two distributions. By restricting the class of cost functions used in the optimal transport formulation, the solution to the optimal transport problem (and hence the transformation function) has been shown to take a simple form (closed form in cases where cdf has a analytical form). Experiments on CIFAR-10, LLD-icon, LSUN, CelebA datasets show that, the minimally modified interpolated codes for several different interpolations produce samples with higher Inception Scores and better visual effects under an improved Wasserstein GAN than the original interpolated codes.

This paper is well written, the studied problem is highly important, and the approach presented has potentially wide applications. 

However, there are some concerns about the experimental evaluations,

1. Although the quantitative evaluations for 2-point and 4-point interpolations are important, it is hard to assess these interpolations in a semantically meaningful way. Extensive quantitative (FID and IS) and qualitative evaluations should be conducted for analogy interpolations. For example, adding glasses, adding mustache, and many others. It is much easier to assess the quality of the generated images from the minimally modified interpolated code for this category in a meaningful way.

2. Another concern is that how big the effect of the transformation function inducing on the latent space operations will be. For example, a linear interpolation is no longer linear after getting transformed. So, are there transformations that drastically transform the original latent space operations? In that case, will the transformed variable make any sense with respect to the original latent space operations? Extensive experiments for analogy interpolations are required to answer these questions.

3. Experiments have been shown only on GAN architectures, however, the framework can be easily extended to VAEs. Experiments on VAEs will be informative.

Minor:

Section 1.1, in the second paragraph, (SLERP) should be moved a correct position.

Given a sample operation, the authors propose to use the so-called optimal transport to map the distribution of the new data to that of the input data that were used training. The optimal transport is essentially a monotonic transformation as the composite of the inverse of the target distribution and the source distribution.

The paper is in general well written. However, I am concerned with two issues here, which are related to the motivation and performance evaluation, respectively. First, the authors didn't make it clear what data generation of the trained generative model suffers from the distribution mismatch issue, although there was some discussion on this in the literature, as the authors mentioned. To me, once the generative model is successfully trained, it is something like a physical process, and new data, which are contained in the support of the training data, can always be used as input to generate new data. (Personally, I think this is very different from covariate shift correction in domain adaptation, in which the correction is necessary because simpler models, instead of flexible, nonparametric ones, are used to make prediction.) Second, the authors used the Inception Score for performance evaluation. Please give this score in the paper and make its definition clear. To me, it is not surprising at all that the proposed method had a better Inception Score: roughly speaking, when we use interpolated values of the training input data to generate images, the Inception Score is expected to decrease, compared to that evaluated on the training data. Intuitively, a very high Inception Score may indicate that we are not trying to generalize, but just memorize the training input data. An explanation about this point would be highly appreciated.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SylZU8FPnQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A clear explanation on distribution mismatch in generative models but needs stronger motivation</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BklCusRct7&amp;noteId=SylZU8FPnQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper399 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper399 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper addresses the latent space distribution mismatch in VAEs and GANs. The authors try to solve the issue by optimal transport theory and the proposed method on the latent space yields better quality in the generated samples.

To me, the motivation is not very strong. In DCGAN, amazingly, latent space linear operations can carry over to the generated images. But itâ€™s not something people are usually concerned with in GANs.  I understand that latent space operations can provide insights into how the trained generator works. But how can it improve the actual GAN training? Choosing Gaussian or uniform distribution for the latent variable is mainly for ease of computation and I am not sure if the motivation to match the distributions is very strong in GAN applications. Perhaps it more important in the context of VAEs.

At the first glance, the proposed form of transformation is not surprising. Though optimal transport is a very powerful theoretical tool, it serves more like an explanation or validation, rather than the motivation. I felt the theory part could be simper.

In the quantitative comparisons with other methods, all simulations seem to be in the context of GAN. The difference in 2-point cases (table 2) is not significant and the author only compares with linear interpolation but not SLERP. I would like to see more quantitative comparisons with other methods and also some empirical studies in the context of VAEs. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
