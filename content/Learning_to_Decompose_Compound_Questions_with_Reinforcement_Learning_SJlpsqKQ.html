Traditional approaches firstly detect topic entity mentioned in questions, then traverse the knowledge graph to find relations as a multi-hop path to answers, while we propose a novel approach to leverage simple-question answerer to answer compound questions. Our model consists of two components: (i) a novel learning-to-decompose agent that learns a policy to decompose a compound question into simple questions and (ii) a simple-question answerer that classifies the corresponding relation to answers. Experiments demonstrate that our model learns complex rules of compositionality as policy, which benefits a simple neural network to achieve state-of-the-art results on the most challenging research dataset. We analyze the interpretable decomposition process as well as generated partitions.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Compound Question Decomposition, Reinforcement Learning, Knowledge-Based Question Answering, Learning-to-decompose</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We propose a learning-to-decompose agent that helps a simple-question answerer to answer compound question over knowledge graph.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJe28_qT27" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Good paper, but need more related work discussions</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJl2ps0qKQ&amp;noteId=BJe28_qT27"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper842 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper842 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary: the paper is interested in parsing compound questions for querying on knowledge graph, e.g. MetaQA by Zhang et al. (2017). The paper proposes to have two modules, one that segments the question into partitions (up to three) and the other that looks at each segment to get the relation. The relations are merged to obtain a single KG path, which is queried to obtain the answer. Since the segmentation is a non-differentiable process, the paper uses reinforcement learning to propagate gradient to the segmentation model. The segmentation is a process of classifying each word for which partition it should be tied to. Answering is a process of classifying the partition into one of the possible relation edges. The model shows expected results in a synthetic arithmetic dataset, and obtains the state of the art in MetaQA, improving nearly 5% over the baseline. The model especially does much better on 3-hop questions, with nearly 20% improvement.

Strengths: the paper is well-written. The model is simple yet effective and is a novel contribution to compound question answering on KG. Especially, the improvement on 3-hop category is nearly 20%, which is substantial and quite impressive. 

Weaknesses: My biggest concern is the lack of discussions on its relevance to  (Iyyer et al., 2016), which also proposed to decompose question into simpler ones for WIkiTableQuestions. Also, I think it would be good to mention Semantic Role Labeling as related literature, which is about tagging each word with its role in the sentence. The partition index can be somewhat considered as a “role” in the sentence.

Questions:
1. How do you obtain x^(k)? Is it the last state of the LSTM?
2. Why did you have to augment “NO_OP” relation in the MetaQA dataset?
3. Why +1 reward has lower variance than probabilistic reward? Explanation or citation would be needed.
4. What if two partitions need to share a word? The current setup necessitates that a word participates in only one partition. Wouldn’t this be problematic?
5. I am a bit confused about how the simple question answering module is trained. Is it directly trained by the gold relation label?

Typos and Suggestions:
- Second paragraph of 2.1: in stead -&gt; instead
- Third paragraph of 2.1: research. -&gt; research
- c_t + h_t: would be good to explicitly mention that the circled plus sign is concatenation.
- Last paragraph on page 4: “leave to be”?
- Second last paragraph of 4.1: he -&gt; The
- Second paragraph of 4.2: “if exists a proper meaning”?
- First paragraph of page 7: be either assume -&gt; either assume
- Last paragraph of Section 5: generalizing -&gt; generalize
- I think you should not put acknowledgment in a double-blind submission.

The decomposition is modeled by assigning each token in the input question to one of the partitions and receiving reward signal based on the final gold answer. The model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the MetaQA dataset. 

My main complaint about the paper is its lack of technical details and analysis of empirical results. Parts of the paper seem quite unclear, for example:

In the last paragraph of Section 3.1, it says “We do not assume that nay question should be divided into exactly three parts. … See section 4 for case study.” Does this mean that the model can have &lt;=3 partitions, but not more? How is this number decided?

Section 3.2 describes the simple-question answer. From Eq (4), it seems that the answerer only uses the current partition, is that the case? Moreover, how is the gold relation r obtained?

It would be nice to add more explanation to the caption of Figure 4 to make it self-contained.

The case study section (4.3) only contains a single example. It would be very helpful to include more examples of question partitions (there is enough space). Error analysis would also be helpful to understand, for example, why the proposed model is worse than VRN (Zhang et al. 2017) on 1- and 2-hop questions.

The key idea is to introduce a sequence labeler to divide the question into at most 3 parts, each part corresponds to a relation-tuple. The labeler is trained with the whole KB-QA pipeline with REINFORCE in an end-to-end way.

The proposed approach was applied to a synthetic dataset and a new KB-QA dataset MetaQA, and achieves good results.

I like the proposed idea, which sounds a straightforward solution to compound question answering. I also like the clarification between "compound questions" instead of "multi-hop questions". In my opinion, "multi-hop questions" can also refer to the cases where the questions (can be simple questions) require multi-hop over evidence to answer.

My only concern is about the evaluation on MetaQA, which seems a not widely used dataset in our community. Therefore I am wondering whether the authors could address the following related questions in the rebuttal or revision:

(1) I was surprised that WebQuestions is not used in the experiments. Could you explain the reason? My guess is that WebQuestions contains compound questions that cannot be simply decomposed as sequence labeling, because that some parts of the question can participant in different relations. If this is not true, could you provide results on WebQuestions (or WebQSP).

(2) There were several previous methods proposed for decomposition of compound questions, although they are not proposed for KB-QA. Examples include "Search-based Neural Structured Learning for Sequential Question Answering" and "ComplexWebQuestions". I think the authors should compare their approach with previous work. One choice is to reimplement their methods. An easier option might be applying the proposed methods to some previous datasets, because the proposed method is not specific to KB-QA, as long as the simple question answerer is replaced to other components like a reader in the ComplexWebQuestions work.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJlV32h2FX" class="note panel trashed"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title">  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJl2ps0qKQ&amp;noteId=rJlV32h2FX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">[Deleted]</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper842 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
