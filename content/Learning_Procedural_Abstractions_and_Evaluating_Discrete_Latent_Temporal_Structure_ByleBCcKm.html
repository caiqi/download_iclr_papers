In this work, we consider the problem of learning procedural abstractions from possibly high-dimensional observational sequences, such as video demonstrations. Given a dataset of time-series, the goal is to identify the latent sequence of steps common to them and label each time-series with the temporal extent of these procedural steps. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model called Prism that models the realization of a common procedure across multiple time-series, and can recover procedural abstractions with supervision. We also bring to light two characteristics ignored by traditional evaluation criteria when evaluating latent temporal labelings (temporal clusterings) -- segment structure, and repeated structure -- and develop new metrics tailored to their evaluation. We demonstrate that our metrics improve interpretability and ease of analysis for evaluation on benchmark time-series datasets. Results on benchmark and video datasets indicate that Prism outperforms standard sequence models as well as state-of-the-art techniques in identifying procedural abstractions.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">learning procedural abstractions, latent variable modeling, evaluation criteria</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Hyx08Tcp2Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Learning procedural abstractions and evaluating discrete latent temporal structure</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByleB2CcKm&amp;noteId=Hyx08Tcp2Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1508 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1508 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">In "Learning procedural abstractions and evaluating discrete latent temporal structure" the authors develop a hierarchical Bayesian model for patterns across time in video data. They also introduce new metrics for understanding structure in time series (completeness and homogeneity). This work is appropriate for ICLR. They provide some applications to robotics, suggesting that this could be used to teach robots to act in environments by learning from videos.

This manuscript paid quite close attention to quality of segmentation, in which actions in videos are decomposed into component parts. It is quite hard to determine groundtruth in such situations and many metrics abound, and so a thorough discussion and comparison of metrics is useful.

The state of the art for Bayesian hierarchical models for segmentation is Fox et al., which is referenced heavily by this work (including the use of test data prepared in Fox et al.) I wonder why the authors drop the Bayesian nonparametric nature of the hierarchy in the section "Modeling realizations in each time-series" (i.e., for Fox et al., the first unnumbered equation in this section would have had arbitrary s).

I found that the experiments were quite thorough, with many methods and metrics compared. However, I found the details of the model to be quite sparse, for example it's unclear how Figure 5 is that much different from Fox et al. But, overall I found this to be a strong paper.

1. the paper proposes a performance metric for sequence labeling, capturing salient qualities missed by other metrics, and
2. the paper also proposes a new sequence labeling method based on inference in a hierarchical Bayesian model, focused on simultaneously labeling multiple sequences that have the same underlying procedure but with varying segment lengths.


This paper is not a great topic fit for ICLR: it's primarily about a hand-designed performance metric for sequence labeling and a hierarchical Bayesian model with Gaussian observations and fit with Gibbs sampling in a full-batch setting. The ICLR 2019 reviewer guidelines suggest "Ask yourself: will a substantial fraction of ICLR attendees be interested in reading this paper?" and based on my understanding of the ICLR audience I suspect not. Based on looking at past ICLR proceedings, this paper's topic and collection of techniques is not in the ICLR mainstream (though it's not totally unrelated). The authors could convince me that I'm mistaken by pointing out closely related ICLR papers (e.g. with a similar mix of techniques in their methods, or similarly proposing a hand-designed performance metric); as far as I can tell, none of the papers cited in the references are from ICLR, but rather from e.g. NIPS, AISTATS, and IEEE TPAMI, which I believe would be better fits for this kind of work.

One way to make this work more relevant to the ICLR audience would be to add feature learning (especially based on neural network architectures). That might also entail additional technical contributions, like how to fit models like these in the minibatch setting (where the current Gibbs sampling method might not apply).


On the proposed performance metric, the discussion of existing metrics as they apply to the example in Fig 3 was really helpful. (I assume, but didn't check, that the authors' characterization of the published performance metrics is accurate, e.g. "no traditional clustering criteria can distinguish C_2 from C_3".) The proposed metric seems to help.

But it's a bit complicated, with several free design decisions involved (e.g. choosing the scoring function \mathcal{H} in Sec 3.1, the choice of conditional entropy H in Sec 3.2, the choice of \beta in Sec 3.3, the choice of the specific algebraic forms of RSS, LASS, SSS, and TSS). Certainly the proposed metrics incorporate the kind of information that the authors argue can be important, but the design details of how that information is summarized into a single number aren't really explored or weighed against alternative designs choices. 

If a primary aim of this paper is to propose a new performance metric, and presumably to have it catch on with the rest of the field, then the contribution would be much greater if the design space was clearly articulated, alternatives were considered, and multiple proposals were validated. Validation could be done with human labelers ranking the intuitive 'goodness' of labeling results (and then compared to rankings derived from the proposed performance metrics), and with comparing how the metrics correlate with performance on various downstream tasks.

Another idea is to take advantage of a better segmentation performance metric and use it to automatically tune the hyperparameters of the sequence labeling methods considered in the experiments section. (IIUC hyperparameters were set by hand in the experiments.). That would make for more interesting experiments that give a more comprehensive summary of how these techniques can compare.

However, as it stands, while the performance metric itself may have merit, in this paper it is not sufficiently well validated or compared to alternatives.


On the hierarchical Bayesian model, the current model design andinference algorithm are okay but don't constitute major technical contributions. I was surprised by some model details: for example, in "Modeling the procedure" of Sec 4.1, it would be much more satisfying to generate the (p_1, ..., p_s) sequence from an HMM instead of sampling the elements of the sequence independently, dropping any chance to learn transition structure as part of the Bayesian inference procedure. More importantly, it wasn't made clear if 'self-transitions' where p_s = p_{s+1} were ruled out, though such transitions might confuse the model's semantics. As another example, in "Modeling the realizations in each time-series" of Sec 4.1, the procedure based on iid sampling and sorting seems unnatural, and might make inference more complex. Why not just sample the durations directly (rather than indirectly defining them via sorting independently-generated indices)? If there's a good reason, it should probably be discussed (e.g. maybe parameterizing the durations directly would make it easier to express prior distributions over *absolute* segment lengths, but harder to express distributions over *relative* segment lengths?). Finally, the restriction to conditionally iid Gaussian observations was disappointing.

The experimental results were solid on the task for which the model's extra assumptions paid off, but that's a niche comparison.

One suggestion on the baseline front: you can tie multiple HMMs to have the same procedure (i.e. the same state sequences not counting repeats) by fixing the number of states to be s (the length of the procedure sequence) and fixing the transition matrices to have an upper-bidiagonal support structure. A similar construction can be used for HSMMs. I think a natural Gibbs sampling procedure would emerge. This approach is probably written down in the HMM literature (it seems every conceivable HMM variant has been studied!) but I don't have a reference for it.


Overall, this paper needs more work.


Minor suggestions:
- maybe refer to "segment structure" (e.g. in Sec 3), as "changepoint structure" (and consider looking into changepoint performance metrics if you haven't already)
- if you used code from other authors in your baselines, it would be good to cite that code (e.g. GitHub links)</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BkgfMLD42X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An interesting contribution on temporal clustering which consists off a new quality criterion and off a new model. </a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByleB2CcKm&amp;noteId=BkgfMLD42X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1508 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">29 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1508 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper describes two distinct contributions: a new compound criterion for comparing a temporal clustering to a ground truth clustering and a new bayesian temporal clustering method. Globally the paper is clear and well illustrated. 
1) About the new criterion:
*pros: *
 a) as clearly pointed out by the authors, using standard non temporal clustering comparison metrics for temporal clustering evaluation is in a way "broken by design" as standard metrics disregard the very specificity of the problem. Thus the introduction of metrics that take explicitly into account time is extremely important.
 b) the proposed criterion combines two parts that are very important: finding the length of the stable intervals (i.e. intervals whose instants are all classified into a single cluster) and finding the sequence of labels. 
*cons:*
 a) while the criterion seems new it is also related to criteria used in the segmentation literature (see among many other <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2012.737745)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2012.737745)</a> and it would have been a good idea to discuss the relation between temporal clustering and segmentation, even briefly.
b) the reliance on a tradeoff parameter in the final criterion is a major problem: how shall one chose the parameter (more on this below)? The paper does not explore the effect of modifying the parameter.
c) in the experimental section, TSS is mostly compared to NMI and to optimal matching (called Munkres here). Even considering the full list of criteria in the appendix, the normalized rand index (NRI) seems to be missing. This is a major oversight as the NRI is very adapted to comparing clusterings with different number of clusters, contrarily to NMI. In addition, the authors claim that optimal matching is completely opaque and difficult to analyse, while on the contrary it gives a proper way of comparing clusters from different clusterings, enabling fine grain analysis. 

2) about the new model
*pros*: 
 a) as far as I know, this is indeed a new model
 b) the way the model is structured emphasizes segmentation rather than temporal dependency: the so called procedure is arbitrary and no dependency is assumed from one segment to another. In descriptive analysis this is highly desirable (as opposed to say HMM which focuses on temporal dependencies). 
*cons*
a) the way the length of the segments in the sequence are generated (with sorting) this a bit convolved. Why not generating directly those lengths? What is the distribution of those lengths under the sampling model? Is this adapted? 
b) I find the experimental evaluation acceptable but a bit poor. In particular, nothing is said on how a practitioner would tune the parameters. I can accept that the model will be rather insensitive to hyper-parameters alpha and beta, but I've serious doubt about the number of clusters, especially as the evaluation is done here in the best possible setting. In addition, the other beta parameter (of TSS) is not studied. 

Minor point:
- do not use beta for two different things (the balance in TSS and the prior parameter in the model)</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
