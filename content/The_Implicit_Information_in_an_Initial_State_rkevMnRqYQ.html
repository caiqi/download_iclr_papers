This means that we must not only tell a household robot what to do, but also prevent it from knocking over a vase or stepping on a toy train. It is easy to forget these preferences, since we are so used to having them satisfied. Our key insight is that when a robot is deployed in an environment that humans act in, the state of the environment is already optimized for what humans want. We can therefore use this implicit information from the state to fill in the blanks. We develop an algorithm based on Maximum Causal Entropy IRL and use it to evaluate the idea in a suite of proof-of-concept environments designed to show its properties. We find that information from the initial state can be used to infer both side effects that should be avoided as well as preferences for how the environment should be organized.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Preference learning, Inverse reinforcement learning, Inverse optimal stochastic control, Maximum entropy reinforcement learning, Apprenticeship learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">When a robot is deployed in an environment that humans have been acting in, the state of the environment is already optimized for what humans want, and we can use this to infer human preferences.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1xfyOLGTm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An interesting idea but less convincing experimental results</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkevMnRqYQ&amp;noteId=r1xfyOLGTm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1273 AnonReviewer4</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">09 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1273 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This work proposes a way to infer the implicit information in the initial state using IRL and combine the inferred reward with a specified reward to achieve better performance in a few simulated environments where the specified reward is not sufficient to solve the task. The main novelty of this work is to reformulate the Maximum Causal Entropy IRL objective using just the initial state as the end state of an expert trajectory to infer the underlying preference. Overall the proposed approach is impressive and the intuition behind the paper is novel and easy to understand.

My main concerns are the following:
- All the simulated experiments are able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, though they seem to be a bit too simplistic, e.g. known dynamics. As mentioned in Section 7, more real-environment experiments would make this method a lot stronger.
- The way of choosing the distribution s_{-T} seems to require some sort of human preference, e.g. in the apple collection case,  s_{-T} has to be sampled from the distribution where there's no apple in the basket in order to make the algorithm to work. This assumption seems to make the implicit information of the initial state not so *implicit*. Besides, it's unclear how to choose the horizon T. It would be interesting to see how the value of T affects the performance.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Byxr6ix6nX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Original formulation of initial state exploration for robot action optimisation - Reinforcement Learning</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkevMnRqYQ&amp;noteId=Byxr6ix6nX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1273 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1273 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The framework of this work is Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimisation. The data consists of states of the space where the action takes place. Actions are possible, and they lead to possible transitions in the state space. A reward function assesses how adequate a state space is.
The main originality of the work is to use the initial state as a key information about the features that translate many desired state of background objects in a scene. An algorithm is built to make use of this information to build an ad hoc reward function, which specifies a good landscape of desired vs non-desired states of the space. An empirical evaluation of the introduced method is presented. It is rich and interesting, although hard to fully grasp for a non-expert.

Key questions/remarks:
 - how different is your approach to a Bayesian approach with the combination of a likelihood (~reward) and prior (~initial state analysis) into a posterior distribution of the space? This seems to be the case in Section 5, where your alternative formulation clearly resembles a Lasso approach (which can be cast in a Bayesian framework).
 - I quite like your decomposition of your ideas into many titled paragraphs. The drawback is that there is sometimes a lack of connections between the many ideas you combine. A would see a big figure in the form of a map as a central contribution of your work to explain the different bits. Still, I appreciate the effort to have a synthetic contribution!

Small remarks:
 - the abstract could be improved to provide an easier reading experience
 - first time IRL on p2 is mentioned, without a prior explanation of the acronym
 - the world is already optimised for human preferences: yes and no, this is one of your (strong?) assumptions. The robot could well move the vase to a location which is acceptable. Or put it back. 
 - on p3, beg.  of Section 3, explain the decomposition of r(s) = \theta^{T}f(s).
 - in IRL paragraph: say the elements of \tau_{i} are s.t. the transitions need be possible.
 - p8 'access to a simulator': what can be simulated if very little is know about the background, but via an initial state?
 - past point of the discussion: I simply don't get it!?!</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJliWzYh3m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An interesting take on combining explicit and inferred reward functions, but limited by unresolved questions and few quantitative results </a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkevMnRqYQ&amp;noteId=BJliWzYh3m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1273 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">04 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1273 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors propose to augment the explicitly stated reward function of an RL agent with auxiliary rewards/costs inferred from the initial state and a model of the state dynamics.  Intuitively, the fact that a vase precariously placed in the center of the room remains intact suggests that it is a precious object that should be handled with care, even though the reward function may not explicitly say so.  Technically, implicit rewards like these are inferred via inverse reinforcement learning: the agent (e.g. robot) first estimates the most likely reward functions to have guided existing agents (e.g. humans) by integrating over all possible state-action paths that could have led to the initial condition and evaluating their probability under different rewards (and hence different optimal policies).  The proposal is clever, but there are some philosophical hurdles to overcome and the experimental results offer little quantitative evidence to support this idea. 

In my view, the biggest challenge is how to balance explicitly stated rewards with those inferred from the initial condition.  Section 5 briefly addresses this question, but essentially capitulates by saying, "This trade-off is inevitable given our problem formulation, since we have two sources of information...and they will conflict in some cases."  I fear this conflict may be the rule rather than the exception.  For example, when I deploy my brand new dish-washing robot on my sink full of dirty dishes, my instructions to clean up will be in direct conflict with my past self's actions (or lack thereof).  How is the agent to know how strongly to adhere to the stated goals and when to deviate?  One possible solution is to only allow the inferred reward to affect features that are not explicitly included in the specified reward.  Neither the Additive nor the Bayesian combination methods have this property though. 

The technical presentation could use some improvement.  The preliminaries in Section 3 do a decent job of introducing MDPs and IRL, but stop short of saying how the objective function for MCEIRL is actually computed.  Specifically, theta does not appear on the right hand side of Eq (1); implicitly, pi is a function of theta that is estimated, presumably, via value or policy iteration.  The marginal probability of the initial state and its gradients presented in Section 4.1 are the main technical contribution of the paper, but most of the key details are deferred to the appendix or referenced to Ziebart (2010).  For example, the dynamic programming algorithm for computing Eq (3) and the expectations over state-action paths in Eq (5) could use more discussion in the main text, as could some elements of the derivation of Eq (5).  

The experimental results are presented primarily in words (e.g. "\pi_spec walks over the vase while \pi_deviation and \pi_reachability both avoid it.").  It would be helpful to see the resulting paths taken by the various agents, or even better, to see their learned reward functions alongside the true reward functions.  The only quantitative results are those in Figure 3, and unfortunately they are a bit confusing.  Why would we expect non-monotonic rewards at some temperatures?  Moreover, why are some reward "percentages" negative?  

The idea of leveraging the initial state for augmenting the reward function is clever, but there are a few shortcomings of the current paper.  There are basic concerns about how implicit and explicit rewards can be combined, and the technical presentation needs some improvement.  Most importantly, the experimental results do not show enough quantitative evidence of how the proposed method performs. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rkl-7cZuo7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Strong paper; minor concerns</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkevMnRqYQ&amp;noteId=rkl-7cZuo7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1273 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">20 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1273 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper considers the problem of inferring unspecified costs in an RL problem (e.g., inferring that vases in a room should not be broken). The primary insight is that the initial state of the environment conveys rich information about such unspecified costs since environments are often optimized for humans. The paper frames the problem of inferring unspecified costs from the initial condition as an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem and applies the Maximum Causal Entropy IRL framework to solve this problem. Two methods are proposed for combining the inferred unspecified costs with specified costs. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a number of simulated examples.

Overall, I was impressed by this paper and I believe that it makes a strong contribution. The paper presents an interesting perspective on a relatively old problem (the frame problem in AI). The primary intuition of the paper (that the initial state conveys information about unspecified costs) and the framing of this problem in terms of IRL is novel. The simulated examples (while relatively simple in terms of the number of states and actions) are informative and demonstrate the strengths of the approach (and also some of the weaknesses; the paper is explicit about the current challenges). The paper is very clearly written and is easy to read.

My concerns are relatively minor:
- Perhaps the weakest bit of the paper is Section 5 (combining the specified reward with the inferred reward). As presented, the Additive method is somewhat hard to justify. However, the simulated results suggest that the Additive method performs slightly better than the Bayesian method. I would suggest either presenting a bit more intuition and justification for the Additive method or getting rid of this method altogether (since the results are not too different from the Bayesian method, which seems a bit more justifiable).
- One practical (and potentially important) question that the paper does not directly address is the problem of choosing the time horizon T (i.e., the time horizon for the past). In the standard IRL setting, it is reasonable to assume that the time horizon is given (since the demonstrations have an associated horizon). However, it is not entirely clear how to choose T in the setting considered in this paper. It is possible that if one chooses T to be too small, the inferred rewards will not be accurate (and one may have to look further back in the past to correctly infer rewards). A discussion of this issue and possible ways to choose T would be helpful.
- In Section 6.1 (baselines), the paper mentions that "while relative reachability makes use of known dynamics, it does not benefit from our handcoded featurization". Is it possible to modify the relative reachability method to also take advantage of the handcoded features, perhaps by considering dynamics over the feature space? If not, a sentence explaining that this is not straightforward would be helpful.
- In the related work section (and also in the introduction), I would recommend being more explicit about precisely what the differences are between the presented work and the approaches presented in (Krakovna et al. 2018) and (Turner, 2018). The paper is currently slightly vague about the differences.
- Currently, the title of the paper is a bit uninformative. On first reading the title, I expected a paper on control theory; the title makes no mention of unspecified costs, or reinforcement learning, or humans, etc. I believe that this is a good paper and that the paper would have more readers if the title was more inline with the content of the paper. Of course, this is at the discretion of the authors. My suggestion would be something along the lines of "Inferring Unspecified Rewards in RL from the Initial State".
