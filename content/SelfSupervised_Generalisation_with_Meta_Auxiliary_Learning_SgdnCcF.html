But typically, this requires manually-defined auxiliary tasks based on domain knowledge. In this paper, we consider that it may be possible to automatically learn these auxiliary tasks to best suit the principal task, towards optimum auxiliary tasks without any human knowledge. We propose a novel method, Meta Auxiliary Learning (MAXL), which we design for the task of image classification, where the auxiliary task is hierarchical sub-class image classification. The role of the meta learner is to determine sub-class target labels to train a multi-task evaluator, such that these labels improve the generalisation performance on the principal task. Experiments on three different CIFAR datasets show that MAXL outperforms baseline auxiliary learning methods, and is competitive even with a method which uses human-defined sub-class hierarchies. MAXL is self-supervised and general, and therefore offers a promising new direction towards automated generalisation.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">meta learning, auxiliary learning, multi-task learning, self-supervised learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We propose Meta AuXiliary Learning (MAXL), a learning framework which can automatically generate auxiliary tasks to improve generalisation of the principal task in a self-supervised manner. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJl-0ufypm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>The paper is an incremental contribution for an artificially sounding problem</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1gd7nCcF7&amp;noteId=rJl-0ufypm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1372 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1372 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes an algorithm for auxiliary learning. Given a target prediction task to be learned on training data, the auxiliary learning utilizes external training data to improve learning. The authors focus on a setup where both target and external training data come from the same distribution but differ in class labels, where each class in the target data is a set of finer-grained classes in the auxiliary data. The authors propose a heuristic for learning from both data sets through minimization of a joint loss function. The experimental results show that the proposed methods works well on this particular setup on CIFAR data set.

Strengths:
+ a new auxiliary learning algorithm
+ positive results on CIFAR data set

Weaknesses:
- novelty is low: the proposed algorithm is a heuristic similar to previously proposed algorithms in the transfer learning and auxiliary learning space
- there is no attempt to provide a theoretical insight into the performance of the algorithm
- the problem assumptions are too simplistic and unrealistic (feature distributions of target and auxiliary data are identical), so it is questionable if the proposed algorithm has practical importance
- experiments are performed using a synthetic setup on a single data set, so it remains unclear if the algorithm would be successful in a real life scenario
- the paper is poorly written and sentences are generally very hard to parse. For example, section 3.1 is opened by statements such as "(we use) a multi-task evaluator which trains on the principal and auxiliary tasks, and evaluates the performance of the auxiliary tasks on a meta set"??</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Bkxpr4aq3m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Not accurate to call it meta-learning, the auxiliary labels might bring few helpful information, lacking comparisons to several important baselines and benchmark datasets.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1gd7nCcF7&amp;noteId=Bkxpr4aq3m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1372 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1372 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes a self-auxiliary-training method that aims to improve the generalization performance of simple supervised learning. The basic idea is to train the classification network to predict fine-level auxiliary labels in addition to the ground-truth coarse label, where the auxiliary labels used in training is generated by a generator network. During training, the classification network and the generator network are alternatively updated, and the update of the latter aims to maximize the improvement of the former after using the generated auxiliary label for training. The method requires a class hierarchy in advance to define the binary mask applied to the output layer for auxiliary class prediction. A KL divergence term is attached to the optimization objective to avoid generating trivial and collapsing auxiliary classes.

Pros:

1) The main idea is simple and easy to understand.
2) It discusses the class collapsing problem in generating pseudo (auxiliary) labels and provides a reasonable solution, i.e., using KL divergence as regularization.
3) Uses several visualizations to show experimental results.

Cons:

1) The problem it aims to solve is neither multi-task learning nor meta-learning: it tries to solve a supervised classification problem defined on principle classes, with the help of simultaneously predicting/generating auxiliary class labels. Although the concept of "task" is not explicitly defined in this paper, the authors seem to associate each task with a specific class. This is not correct: in meta-learning, each task is a subset of classes drawn from a ground set of classes, and different tasks are independently sampled. In addition, the classification models for different tasks are independent, though their training might be related by a meta-learner. Hence, the claims in multiple places of this paper and the names for the two networks are misleading.

2) At the end of Page 4, the authors show that the update of the generator only depends on the improvement of the classifier after using the auxiliary label for training. In fact, the optimal auxiliary labels minimizing the objective is the ground truth label for principle classes. This results in the class collapsing problem observed by the authors. The KL divergence regularization introduces extra randomness to the auxiliary labels and thus mitigates the problem, but it hardly provides any useful information except randomness. In other words, the auxiliary labels for a specific principle class are very possible to be multiple noisy copies of the principal label with random perturbations. So it is not convincing to me that the auxiliary labels generated by the generator can be really helpful. My conjecture is that the observed improvements are mainly due to the softness of the auxiliary labels, which has been proved by model compression/knowledge distillation and recent "born-again neural networks". To verify this, the authors might need to compare the results with those methods (which use the generated soft probability of ground truth classes for training), and the "random-noisy copies of soft principle label" mentioned above.

3) The experiments lack comparisons to several important baselines from self-supervised learning community, and methods using soft labels for training (as mentioned in 2) above). A successful idea of self-supervised learning is to use the output feature map of the trained classification network to generate auxiliary training signals, since it provides extra information about the learned distance beyond the ground-truth labels. The authors might want to compare to "Mathilde Caron, Piotr Bojanowski, Armand Joulin, and Matthijs Douze. Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features. ECCV 2018." and "Carl Doersch and Andrew Zisserman. Multi-task self-supervised visual learning. ICCV 2017." Moreover, since the method is not a meta-learning approach for few-shot learning, it is not fair and also not appropriate to compare with Prototypical Network.

4) Although the paper claims that the ground truth fine labels are not required, it requires a class hierarchy, which in the experiments are provided by the dataset and defined between true coarse and fine classes. In practice, such hierarchy might be much harder to achieve than the primary (coarse) labels, and might be as costly to obtain as the true fine-class labels. This weakens the feasibility of the proposed method.

5) The experiments only test the proposed method on CIFAR100 and CIFAR10, which has at most 100 fine classes. It is necessary to test it on datasets with much more fine classes and much-complicated hierarchy, e.g., ImageNet, MS COCO or their subsets, which have ideal class hierarchy structures.

Minor comments:

Some important equations in the paper should be numbered. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rylvbv_93Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>An interesting idea for applying meta-learning to a problem of learning auxiliary tasks in a self-supervised fashion</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1gd7nCcF7&amp;noteId=rylvbv_93Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1372 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1372 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary:
The role of auxiliary tasks is to improve the generalization performance of the principal task of interest. So far, hand-crafted auxiliary tasks are generated, tailored for a problem of interest. The current work addresses a meta-learning approach to automatically generate auxiliary tasks suited to the principal task, without human knowledge.  The key components of the method are: (1) meta-generator; (2) multi-task evaluator. These two models are trained using the gradient-based meta-learning technique (for instance, MAML).  The problem of image classification is considered only, while authors claimed the method can be easily applied to other problems as well. 

Strengths:
- To my best knowledge, the idea of applying the meta-learning to the automatic generation of auxiliary tasks is novel. 
- The paper is well written and easy to read.
- The method nicely blends a few components such as self-supervised learning, meta-learning, auxiliary tasks into a single model to tackle the meta auxiliary learning. 

Weakness:
- The performance gain is not substantial in experiments. I would like to suggest to use the state-of-the-arts classifier for the principal task and to evaluate how much gain your method can get with the help of auxiliary tasks. You can refer to the state-of-the-arts performance on CIFAR.
- If the information on the hierarchy of sub-categories is not available, it will be an annoying hyperparameters that should be well tuned.
