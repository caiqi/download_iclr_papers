We propose an electron path prediction model (ELECTRO) to learn these sequences directly from raw reaction data. Instead of predicting product molecules directly from reactant molecules in one shot, learning a model of electron movement has the benefits of (a) being easy for chemists to interpret, (b) incorporating constraints of chemistry, such as balanced atom counts before and after the reaction, and (c) naturally encoding the sparsity of chemical reactions, which usually involve changes in only a small number of atoms in the reactants. We design a method to extract approximate reaction paths from any dataset of atom-mapped reaction SMILES strings. Our model achieves excellent performance on an important subset of the USPTO reaction dataset, comparing favorably to the strongest baselines. Furthermore, we show that our model recovers a basic knowledge of chemistry without being explicitly trained to do so.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Molecules, Reaction Prediction, Graph Neural Networks, Deep Generative Models</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">A generative model for reaction prediction that learns the mechanistic electron steps of a reaction directly from raw reaction data.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">5 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BkxM4Zo9nQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A quite interesting contribution that also brings more clearer interpretations on what is learned</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1x4BnCqKX&amp;noteId=BkxM4Zo9nQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1533 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1533 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary:
The paper presents a novel method for predicting organic chemical reactions, in particular, for learning (Robinson-Ingold's) ''arrow pushing" mechanisms in an end-to-end manner. Organic molecules consist of covalent bonds (that's why we can model them as molecular graphs), and organic reactions are recombinations of these bonds. As seen in organic chemistry textbooks, traditional chemists would qualitatively understand organic reactions as an alternating series of electron movements by bond breaking (bond cleavage) and bond forming (bond formation). Though now quantum chemistry calculations can give accurate quantitative predictions, these qualitative understanding of organic reactions still also gives strong foundations to consider and develop organic reactions. The proposed method tries to learn these series of bond changes directly through differentiable architectures consisting of three graph neural networks: 1) the one for determining the initial atom where electron movements start, 2) the one for representing state transitions from  the previous bond change to the next, and 3) the one for determining when the electron movements end. Experimental evaluations illustrate the quantitative improvement in final product prediction against existing methods, as well as give chemical intuitions that the proposed method can detect a class of LEFs (linear electron flows).

Comment:
- This study is a quite interesting contribution because many existing efforts focus on improving differentiable architecture design for graph transformation and test it using chemical reaction data without considering what is learned after all. In contrast, this paper gives the clear meaning to predict "arrow pushing" mechanism from chemical reaction data and also makes sure the limitation to LEFs that are heterolytic. Traditional graph rewrite systems or some recent methods directly borrowing ideas from NLP do not always give such clear interpretations even though it can somehow predict some outputs.

- The presentation of the paper is clear and in very details, and also provides intuitive illustrative examples, and appendix details on data, implementations, and related knowledge. 

- The architecture is based on graph neural networks, and seem natural enough. Basically, I liked overall ideas and quite enjoyed them but several points also remained unclear though I'm not sure at all about chemical points of view.

1) the state transition by eq (2)-(4) seems to assume 1-st order Markovian, but the electron flow can have longer dependence intuitively. Any hidden states are not considered and shared between these networks, but is this OK with the original chemical motivations to somehow model electron movements? The proposed masking heuristics to prevent stalling would be enough practically...? (LEF limitations might come from this or not...?)

2) One thing that confuses me is the difference from approaches a couple of work described at the beginning of section 'Mechanism prediction (p.3)', i.e. Fooshee et al 2018; Kayala and Baldi, 2011, 2012; Kayala et al, 2011. I don't know much about these studies, but the paper describes as "they require expert-curated training sets, for which organic chemists have to hand-code every electron pushing step". But for "Training" (p.6) of the proposed method, it also describes "this is evaluated by using a known electron path and intermediate products extracted from training data". Does this also mean that the proposed method also needs a correct arrow pushing annotations for supervised learning?? Sounds a bit contradicting statements?

3) Is it just for computational efficiency why we need to separate reactants and reagents? The reagent info M_e is only used for the network for "starting location", but it can affect any intermediate step of elementary transitions intuitively (to break through the highest energy barrier at some point of elementary transitions?). Don't we need to also pass M_e to other networks, in particular, the one for "electron movement"?

Paper summary:

The paper proposes a new model for predicting arrow-pushing chemical
reaction diagrams from raw reaction data.

Section 1 summarizes the motivation: whereas other models only predict
chemical reaction products from reactants, the proposed model attempts
to also predict the reaction mechanism.

Section 2 provides a background on related work. Previous models for
mechanism prediction are limited to work which require expert-curated
training sets. The proposed model is designed for a subset of
reactions called "linear electron flow" (LEF) which is
explained. Contributions of this paper are an end-to-end model, a
technique for identifying LEF reactions/mechanisms from
reaction/product data, and an empirical study of how the model learns
chemical knowledge.

Section 3 explains the proposed generative model, which represents a molecule
using a graph (nodes are atoms and edges are bonds). It is proposed to
learn a series of electron actions that transform the reactants into
the products. The total probability is factorized into three parts:
starting location, electron movement, and reaction
continuation. Figure 2 and Algorithm 1 are helpful.

Section 4 explains the proposed method for creating mechanism data
from chemical reactant/product databases. Figure 3 is helpful.

Section 5 discusses results of predicting mechanisms and products on
the USPTO data set.

Comments:

Strong points of the paper: (1) it is very well written and easy to
understand, (2) the chemical figures are very well done and helpful,
and (3) the method for predicting mechanisms seems to be new.

The major weak point of the paper is the results section, which needs
to be improved before publication.

In particular Tables 2-3 (comparison of prediction accuracy) need to
show some measure of variance (standard deviation or confidence
interval) so the reader can judge if there is any significant
difference between models. Please use K-fold cross-validation, and
report mean/sd of test accuracy over the K test folds.

The term "end-to-end" should be defined. In section 2.2 it is written
"End-to-End: There are many complex chemical constraints that limit
the space of all possible reactions. How can we differentiate through
a model subject to these constraints?" which should be clarified using
an explicit definition of "end-to-end."

Also there needs to be some comparison with baseline methods for
predicting mechanisms.  It is claimed that no comparison can be made
against the previous methods for mechanism prediction (Section 2.2),
because "they require expert-curated training sets, for which organic
chemists have to hand-code every electron pushing step." However the
current paper proposes a method for generating such steps/data for LEF
reactions. So why not use those data to train those baseline models,
and compare with them? That would make for a much stronger paper. Please
add at least one of the methods discussed in section 2.2 to your
accuracy comparison in Table 2.

It would additionally be helpful to know what the "uninformed
baseline" / "ignore the inputs" / "random guessing" accuracy rates are
on your data set. For example in classification the uninformed
baseline always predicts the class which is most frequent in the
training data, and in regression it predicts the mean of the
labels/outputs in the training data. What would the analogy be for
your two problems? (product and mechanism prediction)

We can't get SDs/CIs from one-shot evaluations...

USPTO seems also quite a large dataset each representing a set of graphs, and even for LEF reactions (349,898 reactions, of which 29,360 form the held-out test set as in p.7). </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SJlofDCyn7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>good paper, nice contribution</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1x4BnCqKX&amp;noteId=SJlofDCyn7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1533 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">26 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1533 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper presents a novel end-to-end mechanistic generative model of electron flow in a particular type of chemical reaction (“Linear Electron Flow” reactions) . Interestingly, modeling the flow of electrons aids in the prediction of the final product of a chemical reaction over and above problems which attack this “product prediction problem” directly. The method is also shown to generalize well to held-out reactions (e.g. from a chemistry textbook).

General Impressions

+ For me the biggest selling point is that it improves performance in predicting the ultimate reaction outcome. It should do because it provides strictly more supervision, but it’s great that it actually does. 
+ Because it models the reaction mechanism the model is interpretable, and it’s possible to enforce constraints, e.g. that dynamics are physically possible.
+ Generalises outside of the dataset to textbook problems :-)
+ Well-founded modeling choices and neural network architectures.
- Only applies to a very particular type of reaction (heterolytic LEF). 
- Requires supervision on the level of electron paths. This seems to inhibit applying the model to more datasets or extending it to other types of reactions.
- Furthermore the supervision extraction does not seem take advantage of symmetries noted in the section(s) about difficulty evaluating inference. 
- It would be nice to margin out the electron flow model and just maximize the marginal likelihood for the product prediction problem.

Novelty
I’m not an expert on the literature of applying machine learning to the problems of reaction {product, mechanism} prediction but the paper appears to conduct a thorough review of the relevant methods and occupy new territory in terms of the modeling strategy while improving over SOTA performance.

Clarity
The writing/exposition is in general extremely clear. Nicely done. There are some suggestions/questions which I think if addressed would improve clarity.

Ways to improve the paper
1. Better motivate the use of machine learning on this problem. What are the limitations of the arrow-pushing models? 

2. Explain more about the Linear Electron Flow reactions, especially:
- Why does the work only consider “heterolytic” LEF reactions, what other types of LEF reactions are omitted?
- Is the main blocker to extending the model on the modeling front or the difficulties of extracting ground-truth targets? It appears to be the latter but this could be made more clear. Also that seems to be a pretty severe limitation to making the algorithm more general. Could you comment on this?

Questions
1. Is splitting up the electron movement model into bond “removal” and “addition” steps just a matter of parameterization or is that physically how the movements work? 

2. It appears that Jin et al reports Top 6/8/10 whereas this work reports Top 1/3/5 accuracy on the USPTO dataset. It would be nice if there was overlap :-). Do your Top 6/8/10 results with the WLDN model agree with the Jin et al paper?


Nits
Section 2.3, first paragraph “...(LEF) topology is by far the most important”: Could you briefly say why? It’s already noted that they’re the most common in the database. Why?

Section 3.ElectionMovement, first paragraph. “Observer that since LEF reactions are a single path of electrons…”. Actually, it’s not super clear what this means from the brief description of LEF. Can you explain these reactions in slightly more detail?

Section 3.ElectionMovement, second paragraph. “Differently, the above distribution can be split…”. Awkward phrasing. How about “In contrast, the above distribution can be split…”. 

Section 3.Training, last sentence “...minibatches of size one reaction”. Slightly awkward phrasing. Maybe “...minibatches consisting of a single reaction”?

Section 5.2, second sentence. “However, underestimates the model’s actual predictive accuracy…”. It looks like a word accidentally got deleted here or something.

Section 5.2, paragraph 4. “To evaluate if our model predicts the same major project”... Did you mean “the same major product”?
