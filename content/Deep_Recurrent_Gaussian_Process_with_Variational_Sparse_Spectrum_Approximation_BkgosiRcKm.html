Some applications are autonomous driving, virtual sensors and weather forecasting. To model such systems so called recurrent models are frequently used. In this paper we introduce several new Deep Recurrent Gaussian Process (DRGP) models based on the Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Process (SSGP) and the improved version called Variational Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Process (VSSGP). We follow the recurrent structure given by an existing DRGP based on a specific variational sparse Nyström approximation, the recurrent Gaussian Process (RGP). Therefore, we also variationally integrate out the input-space and hence can propagate uncertainty through the GP layers. Further, we combine the (V)SS approximations with a well known inducing-input regularization framework. This case naturally collapses to a tractable expression by calculating the integrals. For the simple extension of the (V)SS approximation an optimal variational distribution exists. Training is realized through optimizing the variational lower bounds. We improve over current state of the art methods in prediction accuracy for experimental data-sets used for their evaluation and introduce a new data-set for engine control, named Emission.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Deep Gaussian Process Model, Recurrent Model, State-Space Model, Nonlinear system identification, Dynamical modeling</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Modeling time-series with several Gaussian Processes in a row via a specific Variational Sparse Spectrum Approximation</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJeVgHjqh7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A combination of existing sparse-spectrum techniques and deep recurrent Gaussian processes but not properly justified</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkgosiRcKm&amp;noteId=HJeVgHjqh7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper650 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper650 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper addresses the problem of modeling sequential data based on one of the deep recurrent Gaussian process (DRGP) structures proposed by Mattos et al (2016). This structure acts like a recurrent neural net where every layer is defined as a GP. One of the main limitations of the original method proposed by Mattos et al (2016) is that it is limited to a small set of covariance functions, as the variational expectations over these have to be analytically tractable.

The main contributions of this paper are the use of previously proposed inference, namely (i) the sparse spectrum (SS) of Lazaro-Gredilla et al (2010); its variational improvement by Gal and Turnner (2015) (VSS);  and the inducing-point (IP) framework of Titsias and Lawrence (2010) into the recurrent setting of Mattos et al (2016). Most (if not all) of the technical developments in the paper are straightforward applications of the results in the papers above. Therefore, the technical contribution of the paper is largely incremental. Furthermore, while it is sensible to use random-feature approximation approaches (such as SS and VSS) in GP models, it is very unclear why combining the IP framework with SS approaches makes any sense at all. Indeed, the original IP framework was motivated as a way to deal with the scalability issue in GP models, and the corresponding variational formulation yielded a nice property of an additional regularization term in the variational bound. However, making the prior over a (Equation 9) conditioned on the inducing variables U is rather artificial and lacks any theoretical justification. To elaborate on this, in the IP framework both the latent functions (f in the original paper) and the inducing inputs come from the same GP prior, hence having a joint distribution over these comes naturally. However, in the approach proposed in this paper, a is a simple prior over the weights in a linear-in-the-parameters model, and from my perspective, having a prior conditioned on the inducing variables lacks any theoretical motivation. 

The empirical results are a bit of a mixed bag, as the methods proposed beat (by a small margin) the corresponding benchmarks on 6 out of 10 problems. While one would not expect a proposed method to win on all possible problems (no free lunch), it will be good to have some insights into when the proposed methods are expected to be better than their competitors. 

While the proposed method is motivated from an uncertainty propagation perspective, only point-error metrics (RMSE) are reported. The paper needs to do a proper evaluation of the full predictive posterior distributions. What is the point of using GPs otherwise?

Other comments:
I recommend the authors use the notation p(v) = … and q(v) = … everywhere rather than v ~ … as the latter may lead to confusion on how the priors and the variational distributions are defined. 
It is unnecessary to cite Bishop to explain how one obtains a marginal distribution
Would it be possible to use the work of Cutajar et al (2017), who use random feature expansions for deep GPs,  in the sequential setting? If so, why aren’t the authors comparing to this?

In these models, uncertainty is propagated by marginalizing out the hidden inputs at every layer.

The authors have combined a series of known ideas in the proposed work. There is a serious lack of discussion or technical insights from the authors for their technical formulations: in particular, what are the non-trivial technical challenges addressed in the proposed work? Furthermore, the authors are quite sloppy in referencing equations and inconsistent in the use of their defined notations and acronyms. I also find it hard to read and understand the main text due to awkward sentence structures.

Have the authors revealed their identity on page 2 of the paper? I quote: "We refer to the report Foll et al. (2017) for a detailed but preliminary formulation of our models and experiments." and "DRGP-(V)SS code available from <a href="http://github.com/RomanFoell/DRGP-VSS."

Detailed comments are provided below:

For the first contribution stated by the authors, what are the theoretical and practical implications of the different regularization terms/properties between the lower bounds in equations 10 vs. 8? These are not described in the paper.

Can the authors provide a detailed derivation of DVI for equation 13 as well as for the predictive distributions in Sectio 6.3.5?

Can the authors provide a time complexity analysis of all the tested deep recurrent GPs?


Would the authors' proposed approach be able to extend the framework of Hoang et al. (2017) (see below) that has generalized the SS approximation of Lazaro-Gredilla et al. (2010) and the improved VSS approximation of Gal &amp; Turner (2015)?

Minor issues:
Just below equation 6, equation 9, and throughout the entire paper, the authors need to decide whether to italicize their notations in bold or not.

Equations are not properly referenced in a number of instances.

The authors have used their commas too sparingly, which makes some sentences very hard to parse.

What is the difference between REVARB-(V)SS(-IP), DRGP-(V)SS(-IP), and DRGP-VSS-IP?

Equation 7: LHS should be conditioned on U.
Page 4:  (V)SSGP does not have the same...
Equation 8: q_a and q_Z should be placed next to the expectation.
Page 4: choosen?
Page 5: will makes it possible?
Page 5: DRGP-SSGP, -VSSGP, -SSGP-IP, -VSSG-IP?
Page 5: to simplify notation, we write h^{L+1}_{Hx+1:} = y_{Hx+1:}? Such a notation does not look simplified.

Equation after equation 12: On LHS, should U^(l) be a random variable?

Page 17: Should the expressions begin with &gt;=?

Detailed Comments: This paper introduces various Deep Recurrent Gaussian Process (DRGP) models based on the Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Process (SSGP) models and the Variational Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Process (VSSGP) models. This is a good paper and proposed models are very sound so I recommend for acceptance although as main weakness I can say that is very technical so it can be difficult to follow. Adding more intuitive ideas, motivation and maybe a figure for each step would be a solution. Apart from that it is a really good paper, congratulations.

Related to: RNN models and Sparse Nystrom approximation.

Strengths: Models are very sound, solutions are solid, the proposed methodology is correct and the empirical results and experiments are valid and properly done.

Weaknesses: It is too difficult to follow and it is written in an extreme technical way. More intuitions and a proper motivation both in the abstract and introduction may be put in order to make the paper easier to read and, hence, more used by researchers and data scientists.

Does this submission add value to the ICLR community? : Yes it does, the experiments show the efficiency of the proposed methods in some scenarios and are valid methodologies.

Quality:
Is this submission technically sound?: Yes it is.
Are claims well supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results?: Experimental results prove empirically the methods and appendixes show the analysis performed in a clear and elegant way.
Is this a complete piece of work or work in progress?: Complete piece of work.
Are the authors careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work?: Yes, and I would enfatize that I have liked that some experiments are won by other methods such as GP-LSTM, they are very honest.

Clarity:
Is the submission clearly written?: Yes, but it is difficult for newcomers due to the reasons that I have stated before.
Is it well organized?: Yes it is.
Does it adequately inform the reader?: Yes it is.

Originality:
Are the tasks or methods new?: Yes, they are sound.
Is the work a novel combination of well-known techniques?: Yes it is.
Is it clear how this work differs from previous contributions?: Yes.
Is related work adequately cited?: Yes, being a strength of the paper.

Significance:
Are the results important?: I would argue that they are and are a clear alternative to consider in order to solve these problems.
Are others likely to use the ideas or build on them?: If the paper is written in a more friendly way, yes.
Does the submission address a difficult task in a better way than previous work?: Yes I think.
Does it advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way?: Yes, empirically.

Arguments for acceptance: Models are very sound, solutions are solid, the proposed methodology is correct and the empirical results and experiments are valid and properly done

Arguments against acceptance: Clarity of the paper.

Minor issues and typos:
-&gt; (V)SS not defined before being used.
-&gt; Abstract should be rewritten adding a motivation and focusing more on the problems being solved and less in the details of the solutions.
-&gt; Recurrent indexes that go backwards (i) of Eq. 1. should be explained why are going backwards before being used like that. Newcomers may be confused.
-&gt; Section 2 writing style lacks a bit of cohesion, relating the paragraphs may be a solution.
-&gt; Q is not defined in section 3.1 paragraph 1.
-&gt; A valid covariance function must produce a PSD matrix, put that in section 3.1. 
-&gt; I do not see how U marginalizes in Eq. 7, kind of confused about that, I think that it should be p(y|X,U).
-&gt; Section 3.4 statistics should be explained.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
