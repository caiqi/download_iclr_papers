We have uploaded a new version of our manuscript with improvements based on reviewer feedback. 

For the novelty and contribution of the paper:

The Related Work section in the updated paper is expanded to more clearly reveal the differences between this paper and previous studies, e.g. Xie et al (2016) and Wang &amp; Ou (2017). 

Learning in Wang &amp; Ou (2017) and in this paper minimizes the inclusive-divergence $KL[p_\theta||q_\phi]$ w.r.t. $\phi$.  But noticeably, this paper presents our innovation in development of NRFs for continuous data, which is fundamentally different from Wang &amp; Ou (2017) for discrete data. The target NRF model, the generator and the sampler are all different.
Wang &amp; Ou (2017) mainly studies random field language models, using LSTM generators (autoregressive with no latent variables) and employing Metropolis independence sampler (MIS) - applicable for discrete data (natural sentences).
In this paper, we mainly develop random field models for continuous data (images), using latent-variable generators and utilizing SGLD/SGHMC (with solid theoretical examination) to exploit gradient information in the continuous space.

In Xie et al (2016), motivated by interweaving maximum likelihood training of the random field $p_\theta$ and the latent-variable generator $q_\phi$, a joint training method is introduced. Operationally, this method also uses Langevin sampling to revise samples generated from $q_\phi$ in updating both $\theta$ and $\phi$. However, two Langevin sampling steps (Langevin revision and Langevin inference) are interleaved according to $ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \log  p_\theta(x)$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial h} \log q_\phi(h,x)$ separately. This is different from our sampling step, which moves $(h,x)$ jointly. Theoretical understanding presented in Xie et al (2016) relates their method to a joint optimization problem, which is also different from ours as shown in Eq. (4).
Thus, learning in Xie et al (2016) does not aim to minimize the inclusive-divergence $KL[p_\theta||q_\phi]$ w.r.t. $\phi$.
[Here we correct our misunderstanding of Xie et al (2016) based on its recent version.]

Please refer to the updated related work for more comparisons. It can been that there are non-trivial differences in model formulation, algorithm development, and theoretical examination between this paper and previous studies. This paper makes significant contribution in learning NRFs, instead of incremental contribution.

To sum up the contribution:
* We propose the inclusive-NRF approach for continuous data with solid theoretical examination on exploiting gradient information in model sampling.
The following developments are significantly new, never been reported before:
 - The Eq. (5) in section 2.1 with Proposition 1 in the Supplement (model formulation);
 - The whole section 2.2 (solid theoretical examination on applying SGLD/SGHMC);
 - The whole section 2.3 (SSL with inclusive-NRFs).
* We show that inclusive-NRFs can be flexibly used unsupervised/supervised image generation and semi-supervised classification, and empirically to the best of our knowledge, represent the best-performed random fields in these tasks.
* Extensive empirical evaluations show that inclusive-NRFs obtain state-of-the-art sample generation quality and achieve strong semi-supervised learning results on par with state-of-the-art DGMs.

Comparing to existing state-of-the-art methods for learning neural random fields, this paper used a the inclusive-divergence (KL divergence of the density approximate and the auxiliary generator) which avoids the intractable entropy term. SGLD/SGHMC are used to revise samples drawn from the auxiliary generator and these two sampling methods are examined theoretically.  

In generally, the paper is well motivated and well written. Experiments are sufficient and convincing, especially the synthetic data experiments with GMM distributions. 

However, I am a little bit concerned that the theoretical contribution seems weak. As discussed in the related work, the idea of using neural network to learn the random field is not new. Using inclusive-divergence is also not new, e.g. Xie et al (2016) and Wang &amp; Ou (2017) already proposed to use the inclusive-divergence. If I understand it correctly, the only contribution here is to apply the SGLD/SGHMC to revise the samples and authors provided some theoretical analysis of SGLD/SGHMC.

The overall technical quality of the paper is sound but I am not 100% sure about the equations, e.g. the second line in Eq. 4. 

In summary, this paper is well written and authors have done a good job. But I will appreciate if authors can elaborate
more on the novelty and innovation of the paper. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1l33IW10Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Author Response</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syzn9i05Ym&amp;noteId=S1l33IW10Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper569 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">18 Nov 2018 (modified: 19 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper569 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">We appreciate that you found our paper to be interesting.

&gt;the idea of using neural network to learn the random field is not new.

Yes but received less attention with slow progress. We significantly advance the learning of NRFs, both theoretically and empirically.

&gt; Using inclusive-divergence is also not new, e.g. Xie et al (2016) and Wang &amp; Ou (2017) already proposed to use the inclusive-divergence.

Yes for Wang &amp; Ou (2017), but no for Xie et al (2016).

However, the target NRF model, the generator and the sampler are all different between Wang &amp; Ou (2017) and this paper, since Wang &amp; Ou (2017) is only for unsupervised learning with discrete data (natural language sentences) and this paper is for continuous data in unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised settings. This paper presents our innovation in development of NRFs for continuous data, which is fundamentally different from Wang &amp; Ou (2017) for discrete data.
 
&gt; The overall technical quality of the paper is sound but I am not 100% sure about the equations, e.g. the second line in Eq. 4. 
 
We add the proof for the second line of Eq. 4 in the new Proposition 1 in the Supplement.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1gFepIt27" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>appears effective, though unfamiliar with this type of model</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syzn9i05Ym&amp;noteId=S1gFepIt27"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper569 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper569 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper describes a method of training NRFs with auxiliary generator networks, using an error that minimizes KL(NRF || generator).  This formulation enables the use of iterative gradient-based stochastic sampling of image samples from the model distribution using SGLD/SGHMC.  Applications to both unsupervised sample generation and semi-supervised classification are evaluated.

I'm not very familiar with these types of NRFs or random sampling techniques, but the approach appears sound and is evaluated rather well.  I would have liked some more background and explicit description and contrast compared to the explicit NRF.  While this is described already, I think the contrasts could potentially be spelled out even more explicitly, particularly in the descriptions of the sampling algorithms.

The toy example with mixture of gaussians is convincing showing the contrast in results between the exclusive NRF, inclusive, and sampling gradient revision steps.

Experimental evaluations on MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR show that the system obtains performance similar to SOA generative systems, in both semi-supervised classification and sample generation.


Questions and comments:

- While the paper claims the results show classification and generation performance are complementary, Table 3 appears to validate the opposite claim, that these are to a large degree a trade-off.  The fact that this system performs well at both is good, but to me it looks like it may be on the "shoulder" of a frontier curve if one were to plot the classification vs generation performance of the different current systems.

- Table 4 and sec 4.4:  I think these could be clearer.  The first observation states that revision improves IS.  But using more iterations (increasing L) does not appear to increase IS.  There does appear to be a consistent increase from the first column (generation) to second (revision), though -- is this what this observation refers to?  In addition, I'm not entirely clear what the "Generation IS" vs "Revision IS" column refers to --- I believe "generation" is the initial sampling of x=g(h) (i.e. h followed by q(x | h)), and "revision" is the application of gradient revision.  But then how does the generation IS results change from row to row (which only modify the revision step)?

&gt; While the paper claims the results show classification and generation performance are complementary, Table 3 appears to validate the opposite claim, that these are to a large degree a trade-off.  The fact that this system performs well at both is good, but to me it looks like it may be on the "shoulder" of a frontier curve if one were to plot the classification vs generation performance of the different current systems.

We do not claim the results show classification and generation performance are complementary. As we comment in the footnote under section 4.3, the conflict of good classification and good generation is reported when using the (K + 1)-class GAN-like discriminator objective for SSL, and does not seem to be reported in previous generative SSL methods (Zhu (2006); Larochelle et al. (2012)) which use the K-class classifier like in semi-supervised inclusive-NRFs.

What we claim is that the conflict of GAN-based SSL is embarrassing and in fact obviates the original idea of generative SSL - successful generative training, which indicates good generation, provides regularization for finding good classifiers (Zhu, 2006; Larochelle et al., 2012). In this sense, Bad-GANs could hardly be classified as a generative SSL method.

The raised viewpoint of trade-off between classification and generation is interesting. Different SSL methods and models, e.g. generative model based SSL (e.g. Zhu, 2006; Larochelle et al., 2012) and discriminative SSL (e.g. Miyato et al., 2017), use different regularization. Does this trade-off exist for all SSL methods and models, and if not, for what type of SSL methods and models? Is the trade-off due to the regularization used? Exploration of such problem is interesting but outside the scope of this paper.

&gt; Table 4 and sec 4.4:  I think these could be clearer. 

Thanks for your suggestion. We update sec 4.4 and add explanation in the caption of Table 4.

&gt; There does appear to be a consistent increase from the first column (generation) to second (revision), though -- is this what this observation refers to?  

Yes.

&gt; In addition, I'm not entirely clear what the "Generation IS" vs "Revision IS" column refers to --- I believe "generation" is the initial sampling of x=g(h) (i.e. h followed by q(x | h)), and "revision" is the application of gradient revision.  But then how does the generation IS results change from row to row (which only modify the revision step)?

Column-wise "Generation IS" vs "Revision IS" is to compare the two manners to generate samples  - whether applying sample revision or not in inference (generating samples) given a trained NRF, as previously illustrated in Figure 1 over synthetic GMM data. For both manners, the NRF model is trained with the sample revision step.

Each row in Table 4 represents a specific setting in model training, such as using SGLD or SGHMC and the revision step $L=1/5/10$ used. Thus, each row produces a specific different NRF model.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1g2osJOnX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Incremental Contribution</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syzn9i05Ym&amp;noteId=r1g2osJOnX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper569 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper569 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper proposes the inclusive neural random field model. Compared the existing work, the model is different because of the use of the inclusive-divergence minimization for the generative model and the use of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) and stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo  (SGHMC) for sampling. Experimental results are reported for unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised learning problems on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Specific comments follow:

1. A major concern of the reviewer is that, given the related work mentioned in Section 3, whether the proposed method exerts substantial enough contribution to be published at ICLR. The proposed method seems like an incremental extension of existing works.

2. A major claim by the authors is that the proposed techniques can help explore various modes in the distribution. However, this claim can only seem easily substantiated by experiments on synthetic data. It is unclear whether this claim is true in principle or in reality.

Other points:
3. the experimental results of the proposed method seems marginally better or comparable to existing methods, which call in question the necessity of the proposed method.

4. more introduction to the formulation of the inclusive-divergence minimization problem could be helpful. The presentation should be self-contained.

5. what makes some of the statistics in the tables unobtainable or unreported?

&gt; A major claim by the authors is that the proposed techniques can help explore various modes in the distribution. However, this claim can only seem easily substantiated by experiments on synthetic data. It is unclear whether this claim is true in principle or in reality.

This claim is empirically validated and reasonable conceptually/intuitively. By the property of minimizing inclusive-divergence, the generator tends to cover modes of the target density $p_\theta$. The SGLD/SGHMC sampling further pushes the samples towards the modes of $p_\theta$. Presumably, this helps to produce Markov chains that mix fast between modes and facilitate model learning.

&gt; the experimental results of the proposed method seems marginally better or comparable to existing methods, which call in question the necessity of the proposed method.

In addition to the strong experimental results of inclusive-NRFs, one fundamental benefit of our inclusive-NRF approach is that, unlike in GANs, we can learn density estimate about the data manifold (partly illustrated in Figure 1).

&gt; more introduction to the formulation of the inclusive-divergence minimization problem could be helpful. The presentation should be self-contained.

Thanks for your suggestion. We expand section 2.1 and provide the new Proposition 1 in the Supplement.

&gt; what makes some of the statistics in the tables unobtainable or unreported?

Thanks for your suggestion. We update Table 3 to differentiate the two cases - 1) the results are not reported in the original paper and without released code; 2) not applicable, e.g. the models cannot generate samples stochastically.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
