  dynamics.  By modeling these dynamics, we can gain insight into how
  these systems work, make predictions about how they will behave, and
  develop strategies for controlling them. While there are many
  methods for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems, existing
  techniques face a trade off between offering interpretable
  descriptions and making accurate predictions.  Here, we develop a
  class of models that aims to achieve both simultaneously, smoothly
  interpolating between simple descriptions and more complex, yet also
  more accurate models.  Our probabilistic model achieves this
  multi-scale property through of a hierarchy of locally
  linear dynamics that jointly approximate global nonlinear dynamics.
  We call it the tree-structured recurrent switching linear dynamical system.
  To fit this model, we present a fully-Bayesian sampling procedure using
  P\'{o}lya-Gamma data augmentation to allow for fast and
  conjugate Gibbs sampling.  Through a variety of synthetic and real examples,
  we show how these models outperform existing methods in both interpretability
  and predictive capability.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">machine learning, bayesian statistics, dynamical systems</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rygVmgaR3Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>a tree extension to previous work rSLDS</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzRQhR9YX&amp;noteId=rygVmgaR3Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1408 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1408 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper introduces a probabilistic model to model nonlinear dynamic systems with multiple granularities. The nonlinearity is achieved by using multiple local linear approximations. The method is an extension to rSLDS (recurrent switching linear dynamical systems),  which in turn is an extension to SLDS. 

Pros:
1. Introducing the tree structure is a neat way of extending the existing rSLDS model to multiscale scenarios. 
2. The paper is written clearly. The background is well illustrated and the idea rises naturally from there. The paper is also solid in the part describing the model. 
Con:
1. from the rSLDS paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08466.pdf)," target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08466.pdf),</a> the authors there was experimenting with some settings similar to those used in this paper. However, I am not able to find some explicit comparison between the TrSLDS and rSLDS in this work. I think it should be needed since TrSLDS itself is derived out from rSLDS, it would be good to show explicitly the advantage of the new model.

This paper introduces a probabilistic generative framework to model linear dynamical systems at multiple levels of resolution, where the entire complex, nonlinear dynamics is approximated via a hierarchy of local regimes of linear dynamics -- the global dynamic is then characterized as a switching process that switches between linear regimes in the hierarchy.

NOVELTY &amp; SIGNIFICANCE:

The key contributions of this paper are (a) the use of tree-structured stick breaking to partition the entire dynamic space into a hierarchy of linear regimes; (b) the design of a hierarchical prior that is compatible to the tree structure; and (c) the developed Bayesian inference framework for it in Section 4.

By exploiting the tree-structured stick breaking process (Adams et al., 2010), the proposed framework is able to partition the entire dynamic space into a hierarchy of switching linear regimes.

This allows the dynamic to be queried at multiple levels of resolution. This appears to be the key difference between the proposed framework and the previous work of (Linderman et al., 2017) on recurrent switching dynamical systems that partition the dynamic space sequentially at the same level of resolution.

This seems like a non-trivial extension to the previous work of (Linderman et al., 2017) &amp; I tend to consider this a novel contribution. That said, the paper was also not positioned against existing literature on hierarchical switching linear dynamic systems (see below) &amp; I find it hard to evaluate the significance of the proposed framework (which explains the borderline rating)

"A Hierarchical Switching Linear Dynamical System applied to the detection of sepsis in neonatal condition monitoring", Ioan Stanculescu, Christopher K. I. Williams and Yvonne Freer. In Proceeding of the 30th Conference on Uncertainty in AI (UAI-14), pages 752-761

Could the authors please discuss the differences between the proposed work &amp; (at least) the above? 

TECHNICAL SOUNDNESS:

The technical exposition makes sense to me. Please also discuss the processing complexity of the resulting TrSLDS framework. In exchange for the improved performance, how much slower TrSLDS is as compared
to rSLDS? I am interested to see this demonstrated in the empirical studies.

CLARITY:

The paper is clearly written.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS:

The experiments look interesting and are very extensive on both test domains. However, I do not understand why the authors decided not to compare with rSLDS using its benchmark? 

I find this somewhat sloppy and hope the authors would clarify this too. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_ryxsWdw927" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting extension to switching linear dynamical systems; scalability concerns and issues with experiments.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkzRQhR9YX&amp;noteId=ryxsWdw927"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1408 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1408 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors develop a tree structured extension to the recently proposed recurrent switching linear dynamical systems. Like switching linear dynamical systems (sLDS) the proposed models capture non-linear dynamics by switching between a collection of linear regimes. However, unlike SLDS, the transition between the regimes is a function of a latent tree as well as the preceding continuous latent state. Experiments on synthetic data as well as neural spike train data are presented to demonstrate the utility of the model.

The paper is clearly written and easy to read. The tree structured model (TrSLDS) is a sensible extension to rSLDS. While one wouldn’t expect TrSLDS to necessarily fit the data any better than rSLDS, the potential for recovering multi-scale, possibly more interpretable decompositions of the dynamic process is compelling. 

While the authors do provide some evidence of being able to recover such multi-scale structures, overall the experiments are underwhelming and somewhat sloppy. First, to understand whether the sampler is mixing well, it would be nice to include an experiment where the true dynamics and the entire latent structure (including the discrete states) are known, and then to examine how well this ground-truth structure is recovered. Second, for the results presented in section 5, how many iterations was the sampler run for? In the figures, what is being visualized?, the last sample?, the MAP sample? or something else? I am not sure what to make of the real data experiment in section 5.3. Wouldn’t rSLDS produce nearly identical results? What is TrSLDS buying us in this scenario? Do the higher levels of the tree capture interesting low resolution dynamics that are not shown for some reason? 

My other big concern is scalability. To use larger number of discrete states one would need deeper (or wider if the binary requirement is relaxed) trees. How well does the sampler scale with the number of discrete states? How long did the sampler take for the various 4-state results presented in the paper? 

Minor:
a) There is a missing citation in the first para fo Section 5. 
b) Details of message passing claimed to be in the supplement are missing.

============
There are interesting ideas in this paper. However, experimental section could better highlight the benefits afforded by the model and scalability concerns need to be addressed.
