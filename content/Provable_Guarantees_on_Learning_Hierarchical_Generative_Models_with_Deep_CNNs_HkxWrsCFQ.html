To show any positive theoretical results, one must make assumptions on the data distribution. Current theoretical works often make assumptions that are very far from describing real data, like sampling from Gaussian distribution or linear separability of the data. We describe an algorithm that learns convolutional neural network,
assuming the data is sampled from a deep generative model that generates images level by level,
where lower resolution images correspond to latent semantic classes. We analyze the convergence rate of our algorithm assuming the data is indeed generated according to this model (as well as
additional assumptions). While we do not pretend to claim that the assumptions are realistic for natural images, we do believe that they capture some true properties of real data. Furthermore, we show that on CIFAR-10, the algorithm we analyze achieves results in the same ballpark with vanilla convolutional neural networks that are trained with SGD.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">A generative model for deep CNNs with provable theoretical guarantees that actually works</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">deep learning, theory</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HyleRy0S6m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Revision to the paper and response to all reviewers</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxWrsC5FQ&amp;noteId=HyleRy0S6m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper60 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">11 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper60 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">We thank the reviewers for their thorough review and helpful feedback. We have tried to address the main concerns raised by the reviewers:

1. Linear separability of the described distribution: a main concern of all the reviewers was that although we described a complex process of generating images, when taking into account all the different assumptions it might become a simple linearly separable distribution. We show that this is not the case, by running a linear classification algorithm on such distribution and measure its performance. We generated a distribution using our model, and indeed showed that a linear classifier achieves very poor performance (around 0.6 accuracy). See Section 3.3.

2. Both Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 3 found the assumptions that were introduced along the paper hard to follow. Following the suggestion of Reviewer 3, we enumerated our distributional assumptions, and clearly stated which ones where assumed for each theorem/lemma.

3. Analysis of the SGD algorithm: for simplicity of the analysis, we gave our theoretical results assuming the training algorithm is gradient descent with respect to the population loss. Since in practice we use SGD, Reviewer 1 asked whether we can prove a similar result for the SGD case. To address this, we have added a theorem similar to Theorem 1 for the stochastic case (SGD), and it is now given in the appendix.

The generative model is hierarchical and interesting although a bit complicated. They then show that when there is only one latent layer (i.e., two overall layers) in the generative model, the latent layer can be learned by gradient descent under a linear convolutional model. Inspired by this, the authors present an algorithm for the general case which involves using the two-layer algorithm iteratively to learn each individual layer of the full model. There is a theoretical result proving that this algorithm works. I find the theoretical results interesting. 

It must be said though that the generative model is quite complicated and somewhat unrealistic. The theoretical results are proved under additional stringent assumptions. For example, Theorem 1 applies to Gradient Descent applied to the population loss as opposed to the actual SGD. Also, the GD in practice here is with respect to both K and W. But the analysis is restricted to the setting where W is fixed. Is it possible to prove a version of Theorem 1 that applies to the actual SGD? Further when Theorem 1 is invoked in the proof of Theorem 2 (specifically in the proof of Lemma 8), the fact that Theorem 1 applies to population loss is glossed over? I also fear that the assumptions in Theorem 2 may be too strong. The fact that one can find orthonormal patches in each layer together with the assumption that the images in the final layer are linearly separable might mean that there is some sort of linear separability overall? It would be good if the authors can clarify this. The conclusion of Theorem 2 (that the algorithm learns a hypothesis with zero error) seems too strong to me (perfect classification is usually possible only under clear separability assumptions). 

The paper is also slightly hard to read with too many assumptions of various kinds floating around.

Based on the architecture of the generative model, a “layer-wise clustering” algorithm for image classification is proposed and theoretically shown to converge to an optimal classifier. Experimentally, the algorithm is shown to have similar performances as a baseline CNN on CIFAR-10.

The main novelty of this paper is the proposed hierarchical generative model and the associated algorithm. One interesting feature is that the network obtained by this algorithm is entirely linear except for the ReLU-pool part. However, the ReLU-pool does not serve as a typical nonlinearity / pooling I believe; rather it sounds to me like a specially tailored step for the theoretical results, which under the “patch orthonormality” assumption is guaranteed to recover the previous layer. Therefore, it surprises me a little bit that the algorithm actually works reasonably well on CIFAR-10. However, as the baseline it compares with is still below "typical", I do want to see if this algorithm can be scaled up to match the performance of more complicated (at least pre-ResNet) models such as VGG.

The theoretical result looks appealing, but I feel like the magic more or less comes from the strong assumptions. In particular, in expectation the output image is just a *linear* operator on the initial (m_0 x m_0 x C_0) one-hot semantic variable. Also, the patch orthonormality assumption implies that intermediate semantics can be perfectly recovered by the (clustering + conv with centroids + ReLU-pool) step, as we are just recovering a partition of a group of orthonormal vectors.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJefuPi_hm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Unsupported claims; assumptions should be more elaborated</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkxWrsC5FQ&amp;noteId=rJefuPi_hm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper60 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper60 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper claims to propose a computationally efficient algorithm for training deep CNNs by making assumptions about the distribution of data. The authors argue that (i) they don't make very simplistic assumptions about the data generating distribution as some other papers do, and (ii) their algorithm resembles the actual methods that are used for training deep models and shows some surprising properties of SGD.

Throughout the paper, the authors make a number of assumptions which seem arbitrary at times; not much justifications are provided. The authors claim that their assumptions are not as simplistic as assuming e.g., the inputs are sampled from Gaussian distribution. Unfortunately this is highly unclear: while the "assumptions" themselves are complex, the combination of those assumptions may make the problem solution trivial. While proving a lower bound to address this issue may be hard, at least the authors should try to illuminate more why the solution is not trivial (e.g., why a linear classifier doesn't work, etc.)

Despite the claims, I find the proposed algorithm very far from the usual SGD-based training methods; this is not a problem per se but I don't think that the result illuminates on the effectiveness of SGD (as the authors suggest). The proposed algorithm is a greedy layer-wise method that in each level does a clustering and also trains a "linear" CNN with SGD. So the hardness of end-to-end training of a deep network does not show up. Furthermore, it is not clear for training a linear CNN the SGD is even needed.

I suggest that the authors name each of the assumptions and clearly say which ones are assumed for which result. Here are some of the assumptions that the authors talk about.

1_ The data is generated by the following recursive procedure: First a small "high-level image" is generated from a distribution, G_0. The "pixels" of this high-level image are supposed to encode semantic classes, e.g., sky or ground. In the next step, each of these high-level pixels are turned into a small (lower-level) image. Therefore, we will have a more refined image after the second step. (each semantic class (e.g., sky) has a corresponding distribution that generates the smaller lower-level image (e.g., uniform over 4 possible types of skies)). This procedure continues recursively until we have the final image.

2_ G_0 is "linearly separable".

3_ Semantic classes defined in the model are different enough from each other

4_ {F_c} corresponding to semantic classes are linearly independent 

5_ Patch Orthonormality (apparently not assumed everywhere) 


it appears that if one assumes all of 1-5, then the problem becomes trivial (linearly separable). The authors then say that we don't want to make assumption 5 for this reason; still, the problem solution may be trivial (authors should at least intuitively justify why it isn't )

Here are some more uses of the word "assumption".

6_ "For simplicity of analysis, we assume only the first layer of the network is trained".

7_ "We assume the algorithm [KMEANS++] returns a mapping [...] such that [...]" 

The experiments do not seem conclusive. Only a few experiments have been done. I think the acquired results for CIFAR-10 are below the usual ones using CNNs, and the effects of various hyper-parameters may have interfered.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
