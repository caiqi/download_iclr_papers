For example, maximum likelihood learning is simple and efficient, yet suffers from the exposure bias problem. Reinforcement learning like policy gradient addresses the problem but can have prohibitively poor exploration efficiency. A variety of other algorithms such as RAML, SPG, and data noising, have also been developed in different perspectives. This paper establishes a formal connection between these algorithms. We present a generalized entropy regularized policy optimization formulation, and show that the apparently divergent algorithms can all be reformulated as special instances of the framework, with the only difference being the configurations of reward function and a couple of hyperparameters. The unified interpretation offers a systematic view of the varying properties of exploration and learning efficiency. Besides, based on the framework, we present a new algorithm that dynamically interpolates among the existing algorithms for improved learning. Experiments on machine translation and text summarization demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">sequence generation, maximum likelihood learning, reinforcement learning, policy optimization, text generation, reward augmented maximum likelihood, exposure bias</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">A unified perspective of various learning algorithms for sequence generation, such as MLE, RL, RAML, data noising, etc.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1xuDmP93Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>AR3 Review: Connecting the Dots Between MLE and RL for Sequence Generation</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1MxciCcKm&amp;noteId=B1xuDmP93Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper505 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper505 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors propose a more unified view of disparate methods for training sequence models. Specifically, a multi-term objective L(q,theta) consisting of:
1) The standard reward maximization objective of policy gradient, E_{p_\theta}[R], 
2) A weighted (weight alpha) reverse KL divergence of the parametric policy and a non-parameteric policy q, 
3) A weighted (weight beta) entropy term on q, 
Is proposed for sequence training (see equation (1). L can be iteratively optimized by solving for q given p_\theta, and the \theta given q (see eq. 2).

This framework mathematically generalizes softmax-policy gradient (SPG, alpha=1, beta=0), and reward-augmented maximum likelihood (alpha=0, beta=temperature), and also standard entropy regularized policy gradient (alpha=0), among other algorithms.

The paper is well written, and the approach sensible. However, combining SPG and RAML by introducing their respective regularization terms is a rather straightforward exercise, and so seems quite incremental.

Other major concerns are:
1) the true utility of the model, and 
2) the integrity of the experiments. 

Wrt: 
1), While RAML was a significant contribution at the time, it is now well established that RAML generally doesn't perform well at all in practice due to exposure bias (not conditioning on it's own previous predictions during training). Moreover SPG, as the authors point out, was supposed to address the need for ML pre-training, but required much engineering to work. The fact is that REINFORCE-based policy gradient methods are still more effective than these methods, provided they have a good baseline to reduce varince. Which brings me to point 
2) Was MIXER run with a learned baseline and judiciously optimized? Table 1 suggests that MIXER can outpeform ML by only 0.1 Bleu points, and outpeformed by RAML? Something is wrong with your implementation then. Moreover, there are techniques like self-critical sequence training (SCST), which far outpeform MIXER, and we haven't even discussed Actor-Critic baselines...

In summary, the contribution over RAML and SPG in combining them is quite incremental, and the practical importance of combining them is questionable, as is the integrity of the presented experiments, given how poorly MIXER is reported perform, and the omission of stronger baselines like SCST and AC methods. Also, a paper on essentially the same approach was submitted and rejected from ICLR 2018(<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H1Nyf7W0Z)," target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H1Nyf7W0Z),</a> although this paper is better written, and puts the method more fully in context with existing work, I think that several of the concerns with that paper apply here as well. 

Look forward to the authors' feedback, and additional/corrected results - will certainly update my score if these concerns are addressed. In particular, if this generalization can significantly outpeform existing methods it generalizes with non-degenerate settings, this would overcome the more incremental contribution of combining SPG and RAML.

Current Ratings:

Evaluation      2/5: Results are not consistent with previous results (e.g. MIXER results). Stronger baselines such as SCST and AC are not considered.
Clarity         5/5: Clear paper, well written.
Significance    3/5: RAML and SPG have not been established as important methods in practice, so combining them is less interesting.
Originality     2/5: RAML and SPG are fairly straightforward to combine for experts interested in these methods.

Rating          4/10 Okay but not good enough, reject.    
Confidence      5/5

Pros: 
- Generalizes RAML and SPG (and also standard entropy-regularized policy gradient).
- Well written paper, clean generalization.
Cons:
- RAML and SPG have not been established as important methods in practice.
- generalization of RAML and SPG is straightforward,  incremental.
- Existing baselines in the paper (i.e. MIXER) do not perform as expected (i.e barely better than ML, worse than RAML)
- Stronger REINFORCE-based algorthms like SCST, as well as Actor-critic algorithms, have not been compared.

They also introduce a new algorithm that combines several of the existing ones and achieves significant (but small) improvements on a machine translation and a text summarization task.

The paper is clearly written, giving a good exposition of the unifying formulation.

I believe the paper is quite insightful, and contributes to the community's understanding of the learning algorithms. However, the improvements in their experiments are rather small, and could probably be improved with more experimental work. They do showcase the usefulness of their new formulation, but not very strongly. Thus my recommendation to accept the paper is mostly based on the theoretical content that opens an interesting new perspective.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJl84_xU3m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting unifying perspective, but lacklustre experiments</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1MxciCcKm&amp;noteId=HJl84_xU3m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper505 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">30 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper505 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper introduces an interesting unifying perspective on several sequence generation training algorithms, exposing both MLE, RAML and SPG as special cases of this unified framework. This enables insightful new interpretations of standard issues in MLE training in terms of exploration for instance.
Based on this new perspective, a new algorithm is introduced. Its performance is analysed on a machine translation and a text summarisation task.

==&gt; Quality and clarity
The paper is overall well-written, although it can be improved upon (see details below). The bibliography for instance does not reference the conference/journals where the articles were published and lists many (&gt;10) published papers as arXiv preprints.

The ideas are clearly presented, which is crucial in a paper trying to unify different approaches, and the new perspective on exploration is well motivated.

==&gt; Originality and significance
The unifying framework is interesting, and helps shed new light on some standard issues in sequence generation.
On the other hand, the new algorithm and its analysis seem like a slightly rushed attempt at leveraging the unifying framework. 
The experiments, in particular, present several issues.
- For instance, it's clear from Figure 3 that both MLE and RAML are overfitting and would benefit from more dropout (in the literature, 0.3 is commonly used for this type of encoder-decoder architecture). Having access to these experimental results is important, since it would enable the reader to understand whether the benefits of the new approach are subsumed by regularisation or not.
- Further, the performance of the competing methods seems a bit low. MLE reports 26.44 BLEU, which is a bit surprising considering that: 
   - with beam-search (beam of size 10, not 5, admittedly), Bahdanau et al (2016) get 27.56 BLEU, and this is without dropout.   
   - with dropout 0.3 (but without beam search), Leblond et al (2018) get 27.4 BLEU.
Making a strong case for the benefits of the new algorithm requires more thorough experiments.

Overall, the first half of the paper is interesting and insightful, while the second would benefit from more time. 

Pros
- clarity of the ideas that are presented
- interesting unifying perspective on sequence generation algorithms
- insightful new interpretations of existing algorithms in terms of exploration

Cons
- the example new algorithm is not very original
- the associated experiments are incomplete

==&gt; Details
1. page 2, "Dayan &amp; Hinton (1997); Levine (2018); Abdolmaleki et al. (2018) study in a probabilistic inference perspective." is an incomplete sentence.
2. at the beginning of section 3.1, policy optimisation is a family of algorithmS
3. page 7 in the setup of the experiments, "We use the Adam optimizer for SGD training" is incorrect since SGD is not a family but a specific algorithm, which is different from Adam.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
