These representations predicted a latent similarity structure between objects, which captured most of the explainable variance in human behavioral judgments. Individual dimensions in the low-dimensional embedding were found to be highly reproducible and interpretable as conveying degrees of taxonomic membership, functionality, and perceptual attributes. We further demonstrated the predictive power of the embeddings for explaining other forms of human behavior, including categorization, typicality judgments, and feature ratings, suggesting that the dimensions reflect human conceptual representations of objects beyond the specific task.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">category representation, sparse coding, representation learning, interpretable representations</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Human behavioral judgments are used to obtain sparse and interpretable representations of objects that generalize to other tasks</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1x6zNA92m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting well done paper</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryxSrhC9KX&amp;noteId=S1x6zNA92m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1536 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1536 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Following the suggested rubric:

1.  I work at the intersection of machine learning and biological vision
and have worked on modeling word representations.

2. This paper develops a new representation system for object
representations from training on data collected from odd-one-out human
judgements of images.  The vector representation for objects is
designed to be sparse and low dimensional (and ends up being about
49D).  Similarity is measured by dot products in the space and
probabilities of which pair of items will be paired are modeled as the
exponential of the similarity.


3,5  The resulting embedding	does a good job	of predicting human similarity
judgements and seems to cover similar features to those named by
humans.  They also explain typicality judgements and cluster semantic
categories well.   The creation of the upper limit based on noise between 
and within subjects was a nice addition.


4. Some relevant related work is discussed and this seems like a novel
and interesting contribution.  The authors might also want to compare
to similar work that looked at similarities among triplets (Similarity
Comparisons for Interactive Fine-Grained Categorization
<a href="http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~smaji/papers/similarity-cvpr14.pdf;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~smaji/papers/similarity-cvpr14.pdf;</a>
Conditional Similarity Networks https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07810 ).


6. While this paper is not especially surprising or ground breaking, the
number and quality of the comparisons make it a worthwhile
contribution and the resulting embeddings are worth further exploration
and could be very useful for future research.

The authors have collected the dataset themselves and have rating of sets of 3 objects from 1854 unique objects. They end up with a space (SPoSE) with relatively low dimensionality with respect to usual word embeddings (49 dimension) but perhaps not surprising when considering the small size of the words to embed. The authors run a set of experiment to show the usefulness of SPoSE. The most interesting one is the prediction of its dimensions by the CSLB features, which reveals a nice clustering in the different SPoSE dimensions. Perhaps the results would be a little more convincing if additional common word embeddings were also tested.

Due to the different objects used in the different datasets, some of the experiments have a smaller set of words. A good extension of this work would be to combine a text-derived embedding  or the synsets to interpolate the SPoSE dimensions for missing words in the original set. Or perhaps the object similarity ratings could be used in a semi-supervised setting to inform the learning of a co-occurence word embedding. This will allow the model to better describe a larger set of words. Another possible extension is to test this larger set of words on a non-behavioral NLP task to show possible improvements that the behavioral data and the interpretable space give.

The experiment could have been more carefully controlled (and described in the paper) and the modeling work is inconclusive.

Quality, 
The experiment design is conventional, based on rating pair-wise similarity among triplets. Compared to earlier experiments, this data has more objects and more triplets.  Additional control experiments on smaller subsets have been carried out to further address hypotheses.  The description of the experiment could have been more careful: What are the precise instructions, how are the object/images presented (it is well known that relative positions, asymmetry, etc can play an important role), are there any temporal/learning effects (how clear is the task to the workers?).
The modeling work is basic and contains a number of steps that have unknown influence on the final outcome. For example model dimension: Is you claim that "D=49" is a law of human nature?  Model predictive performance seems excellent, that is interesting! But we do not know how robust this is to the many heuristics

Clarity, 
The presentation of the inference process is clear. Not so clear what the uncertainties are

Originality 
Limited. Mainly related to scale. But the data quality is unclear. The modeling approach involves a number of untested heuristics (non-negative, exponentiation etc). 

Significance 
Mostly related to the data.  I did not understand if it is planned to release the data.

Pros and cons 

+Large scale experiment
+simple model, seem to have good accuracy

-experiment needs more careful description
-too many heuristics in model and inference, unclear how general the conclusions are
