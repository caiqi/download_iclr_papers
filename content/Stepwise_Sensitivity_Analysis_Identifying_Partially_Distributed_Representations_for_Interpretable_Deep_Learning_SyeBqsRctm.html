# Method summary

The approach is as follows:
For each layer, the gradient w.r.t. it's input layer is computed for multiple images concurrently.
Then for conv layers, the activations are averaged per feature map (over space).
As a result, for both fully connected and convolutional layers there is a 3D feature map.
From these at most b positive outliers are selected to be propagated further. 
What is a bit strange is that in the results section, guided backpropagation is mentioned and clearly used in the visualizations but not mentioned in the technical description.

# Recommendation

The current evaluation is definitely not sufficient for acceptance. 
The evaluation is done in a purely qualitative matter (even in section 4.1 Quantitive justification of outliers as relevant neurons). The results appear to be interesting but there is no effort done to confirm that the neurons considered to be relevant are truly relevant. On top of that, it is also evaluated only on a single network and no theoretical justification is provided.

# Discussion w.r.t. the evaluation

To improve section 4.1,  the authors could for example drop out the most important neurons and re-evaluate the model to see whether the selected neurons have a larger impact than randomly selected neurons. Since the network is trained with dropout, it should be somewhat robust to this. This would not be a definitive test, but it would be more convincing than the current evaluation. Furthermore high values do not imply importance. 

It might be possible that I misunderstood the experiment in Figure 2. So please correct me if this is the case in the reasoning below. 
In figure 2, FC2 is analyzed. This is the second to last layer. So I assume that only the back-propagation from logits (I make this assumption since this is what is done commonly and it is not specified in the paper) to FC2 was used. Since we start at the same output neuron for a single class, all visualisations will use the same weight vector that is propagated back. The only difference between images comes from which Relu's were active but the amount if variability is probably small since the images were selected to be classified with high confidence. Hence, the outliers originate from a large weight to a specific neuron. 

The interpretation in the second paragraph of section 4.2.1 is not scientific at all. I looked at the German Shepherd images and there are no teeth visible. But again, this is a claim that can be falsified easily. Compare the results when german Shepherds with teeth visible are used and when they are not. The same holds for the hypothesis of the degree of danger w.r.t. the separation. 

Finally, there is no proof that the approach works better than using the magnitude of neuron activations themselves, which would be an interesting baseline. 

Additional remarks
---------------------------

The following is an odd formulation since it takes a 3D tensor out of a 5D one and mixes these in the explanation:
"... the result of equation for is a 5D relevance tensor $\omega^l_{n,i,..} \in R^{H\times W\times K} ....."

The quality of the figures is particularly poor. 
- Figure 1 b did not help me to understand the concept.
- Figure 2 The text on the figure is unreadable. 
- Figure 4a is not readable when printed. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: Clear rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SJlqCanjnX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Ok but not good enough</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyeBqsRctm&amp;noteId=SJlqCanjnX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper530 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">04 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper530 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary: 
This paper introduces step-wise sensitivity analysis (SSA), which is a modification of saliency maps (Baehrens et al. 2010, Simonyan et al. 2013) to a per-layer implementation. Instead of only measuring the importance of input nodes (e.g. pixels) to the classification, SSA measures the importance of all nodes at each layer. This allows for a way to find the important sub-nodes for each node in the tree given a particular sample. It is then straightforward to aggregate results across different input samples and output a dependency graph for nodes.

Novelty:
The technical contribution is a very simple extension of Simonyan et al. 2013. The main novelty lies within the created dependency graph from the node importance weights, but the usefulness of such graph is unclear. In addition, the claim that this is the first method that aggregates results of an instance-specific method to gain model-centric results is a stretch considering other works have found important nodes or filters for a specific class by aggregating across instance-specific samples (Yosinski et al. 2015).

Evaluation: 
The idea of producing an interpretable dependency graph for nodes is interesting, and the possible conclusions from such graphs seem promising. However, most of the interesting possible conclusions seem to be put off for future work. I don’t believe the experiments are sufficient to show the significance of SSA. The main hypothesis is that dependency graphs allow for a way to interpret the model across samples, but it doesn’t show any conclusive results about the data or models that wasn’t previously known. The results are mostly speculative, such as the fact that German shepherd and great white shark nodes are clustered together, possibly due to the fact that both of these classes share a PDR encoding sharp teeth, but that is never actually demonstrated.

The paper introduces a new approach for interpreting deep neural networks called step-wise sensitivity analysis. The approach is conceptually quite simple and involves some interesting ideas, but I have some serious concerns whether the output produced by this method carries any meaning at all. If the authors were able to refute my concerns detailed below, I would raise my score substantially.


Strengths:
+ Potentially interesting heuristic to identify groups of feature channels in DNNs that encode image features in a distributed way


Weaknesses:
- Using the magnitude of the gradient in intermediate layers of ReLU networks is not indicative of importance
- No verification of the method on a simple toy example


Details:


Main issue: Magnitude of the gradient as a measure of importance.

I have trouble with the use of the gradient to identify "outliers," which are deemed important. Comparing the magnitude of activations across features does not make sense in a convnet with ReLUs, because the scale of activations in each feature map is arbitrary and meaningless. Consider a feature map h^l[i,x,y,f] (l=layer, i=images, x/y=pixels, f=feature channels), convolution kernels w^l[x,y,k,f] (k=input channels, f=output channels) and biases b^l[f]:

h^l[i,:,:,f] = ReLU(b^l[f] + \sum_k h^(l-1)[i,:,:,k] * w^l[:,:,k,f])

Assume, without loss of generality, the feature map h^l[:,:,:,f] has mean zero and unit variance, computed over all images (i) in the training set and all pixels (x,y). Let's multiply all "incoming" convolution kernels w^l[:,:,:,f] and biases b^l[f] by 10. As a result, this feature map will now have a variance of 100 (over images and pixels). Additionally, let's divide all "outgoing" kernels w^(l+1)[:,:,f,:] by 10.

Simple linear algebra suffices to verify that the next layer's features h^(l+1) -- and therefore the entire network output -- are unaffected by this manipulation. However, the gradient of all units in this feature map is 10x as high as that of the original network. Of course the gradient in layer l-1 will be unaltered once we backpropagate through w^l, but because of the authors' selection of "outlier" units, their graph will look vastly different.

In other words, it is unclear to me how any method based on gradients should be able to meaningfully assign "importance" to entire feature maps. One could potentially start with the assumption of equal importance when averaged over all images in the dataset and normalize the activations. For instance, ReLU networks with batch norm and without post-normalization scaling would satisfy this assumption. However, for VGG-16 studied here, this is not the case.

On a related note, the authors' observation in Fig. 4b that the same features are both strongly positive and strongly negative outliers for the same class suggests that this feature simply has a higher variance than the others in the same layer and is therefore picked most of the time. Similarly, the fact that vastly different classes such as shark and German Sheppard share the same subgraphs speaks to the same potential issue.


Secondary issue: No verification of the method on simple, understandable toy example.

As shown by Kindermans et al. [1], gradient-based attribution methods fail to produce the correct result even for the simplest possible linear examples. The authors do not seem to be aware of this work (at least it's not cited), so I suggest they have a look and discuss the implications w.r.t. their own work. In addition, I think the authors should demonstrate on a simple, controlled (e.g. linear) toy example that their method works as expected before jumping to a deep neural network. I suppose the issue discussed above will also surface in purely linear multi-layer networks, where the intermediate layers (and their gradients) can be rescaled arbitrarily without changing the network's function.
