Standard solutions such as soft-max cross-entropy and mean squared error are effective but parametric, meaning that known inductive structures such as maximum margin separation and simplicity (Occam’s Razor) need to be learned for the task at hand.  Instead, we propose polar prototype networks, a class of networks that explicitly states the structure, i.e. the layout, of the output. The structure is defined by polar prototypes, points on the hypersphere of the output space. For classification, each class is described by a single polar prototype and they are a priori distributed with maximal separation and equal shares on the hypersphere.  Classes are assigned to prototypes randomly or based on semantic priors and training becomes a matter of minimizing angular distances between examples and their class prototypes. For regression, we show that training can be performed as a polar interpolation between two prototypes, arriving at a regression with higher-dimensional outputs. From empirical analysis, we find that polar prototype networks benefit from large margin separation and semantic class structure, while having a minimal description length in the output space.  While the structure is simple, the performance is on par with (classification) or better than (regression) standard network methods.  Moreover, we show that we gain the ability to perform regression and classification jointly in the same space, which is disentangled and interpretable by design.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">prototype networks, polar prototypes, output structure</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">This work proposes a class of networks that can jointly perform classification and regression by imposing layout structures in the network output space.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HJeS3pI8hm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting idea but need more convincing experiments</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syx4_iCqKQ&amp;noteId=HJeS3pI8hm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper343 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">31 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper343 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper proposes a unified framework for both classification and regression and a combination of both using pre-designed prototypes distributed on a hypersphere with max separation. It is nice to see an alternative to the dominant cross-entropy loss and l2 loss for deep classification and regression respectively, also the ability to tackle both in a shared output space is a plus. However, the experiments are limited and not convincing that the proposed framework offers a genuine alternatives to existing formulations. 

Pros:

•	The over idea appears to novel, despite its connections to various previous attempts to angular separation (Hasnat et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017a; Wang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2018).
•	It is nice to see a framework that can perform classification/regression multi-task learning. Many computer vision problems have this nature, e.g. object recognition and pose estimation; face recognition and age estimation. So addressing both problems jointly can potentially bring in mutual benefits.  

Cons:

•	The experiments on CIFAR 10/100 seems to be at par with a conventional cross-entropy loss. It would be more convincing if more experiments on other more challenging datasets (e.g. ImageNet) using more powerfully backbone networks (e.g. densenet) can be provided.
•	In the CIFAR experiments the hypersphere space dimension is set to the same as the number of classes. In this case, why not just use a one-hot vector to represent each class, and do L2 normalization to the output of the feature extraction network and then do softmax cross-entropy? As pointed out in Section 4, several works project network outputs to the hypersphere for classification through L2 normalization, which forces softmax cross-entropy to optimize for angular separation (Hasnat et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017a; Wang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2018). These works should be compared here to convince the readers why it is necessary to use evolutionary algorithm or Monto-Carlo sampling to set the prototypes rather than just using one-hot vectors.

To do so, one maps the target variable into "maximally separating prototypes" laid in the D-hypersphere. For classification, the learning problem reduces to minimizing the angle between D-dimensional feature vectors and the associated D-dimensional polar prototype. A similar strategy applies to regression, where the continuous target variable is squeezed to the range of the hypersphere.

The authors claim that their method unifies, as opposed to much prior art, classification and regression approaches. I disagree with this claim, since we usually approach classification as a (normalized!) regression problem. In some cases the normalization is on the entire output space (single-label classification as in ImageNET), and in some other cases this normalization happens separately in each component of the output space (multi-label classification as in COCO). It is even possible to train an ImageNET classifier using mean squared error given unit-norm feature vectors (Tygert et al, 2017). As such, the "unification" proposed by the paper seems a bit blurry to me.

I am unconvinced about the impact shown by the experiments. Table 1 shows accuracies far from the state-of-the-art (91% for all methods in CIFAR-10 versus 97% SOTA, 65% for the proposed method versus 75% SOTA) and throw some separation statistics without a clear correlation to accuracy. The experiment on semantic priors is inconclusive, as all non-baseline results are within error bars. The impact of Section 3.3. is also unclear, since obtaining semantic (digit rotation) interpolations in MNIST is a common feat achieved by unsupervised learning algorithms with decent feature learning.

The results from section 3.2 are interesting, although I would be interested in seeing a reduction-to-classification baseline, where the years are clustered to set up a classification problem, and the prediction is fine-tuned by a local regression.

For classification, the prototypes for all classes are chosen in advance based on a max-margin principle, while the embedding of all instances is then optimized to have small cosine distance to assigned prototypes. For the regression, the output value is interpolated between the two prototypes. Experiments on classification, regression, and combined tasks show the method can achieve good results.

The idea of using the prototype and the polar system is interesting, and the whole paper is well-written. However, there are still some problems and questions about this paper.
1. There are two problems with using the max-margin prototypes. First, to maximize the smallest distance between two prototypes, the authors use MC or evolutionary algorithms to do the optimization, which may be time-consuming, and it may be extremely difficult when the prototype space is high dimension. Second, the previous approach indeed obtains discriminative prototypes, but we lose the **class correlation**. In the extreme case, it is equal distance between all prototypes, but some similar classes will have a smaller prototype distance than others. For example, the prototype distance between "cat" and "dog" should not be the same as that between "car1" and "car2". The semantic consideration in the paper can solve this problem to some extent, but there needs more evidence.

Using the pre-defined prototype is also considered in the paper "M. Perrot et al. Regressive Virtual Metric Learning. NIPS15". 

2. For the unified output space
One main contribution is that based on the polar system, the method unifies both classification and regression tasks in the same space. We can also do this in basic embedding algorithms. In the embedding space, a method can do both classification and regression with the nearest neighbor rule (based on majority voting and average respectively). The authors should compare with such kinds of methods in the experiments.

3. Experiments
From the experiments, using semantic cannot improve a lot for the classification task. The authors can try more datasets to validate is this the common scenario. The reviewer strongly suggests the authors should compare with more methods. For example, in some papers the prototypes are learned simultaneously (Snell et al. Prototypical networks for few-shot learning. NIPS17; Wen et al. A discriminative feature learning approach
for deep face recognition. ECCV16); while in other cases, there are no prototypes as we optimize the triplet/contrastive loss directly. First, the authors can compare classification performance with these approaches; besides, some visualization results can also show the used prototypes or embeddings. 
The main advantage of the method is not stressed clearly in the experiments part. The authors can clarify it in later versions.

The final rating depends on the authors' response.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
