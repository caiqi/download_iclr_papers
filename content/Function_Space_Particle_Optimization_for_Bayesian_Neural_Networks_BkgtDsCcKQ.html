To address this issue, several highly flexible and scalable variational inference procedures based on the idea of particle optimization have been proposed. These methods directly optimize a set of particles to approximate the target posterior. However, their application to BNNs often yields sub-optimal performance, as such methods have a particular failure mode on over-parameterized models. In this paper, we propose to solve this issue by performing particle optimization directly in the space of regression functions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our method successfully overcomes this issue, and outperforms strong baselines in a variety of tasks including prediction, defense against adversarial examples, and reinforcement learning.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Bayesian neural networks, uncertainty estimation, variational inference</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HyloUTy5nQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Very promising technique, but requires clarification</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkgtDsCcKQ&amp;noteId=HyloUTy5nQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper282 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper282 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors address the problems of variational inference in over-parameterized models and the problem of the collapse of particle-optimization-based variational inference methods (POVI). The authors propose to solve these problems by performing POVI in the space of functions instead of the weight space and propose a heuristic approximation to POVI in function spaces.

Pros:
1) I believe that this work is of great importance to the Bayesian deep learning community, and may cause a paradigm shift in this area.
2) The method performs well in practice, and alleviates the over-parameterization problem, as shown in Appendix A.
3) It seems scalable and easy to implement (and is similar to SVGD in this regard), however, some necessary details are omitted.

Cons:
1) The paper is structured nicely, but the central part of the paper, Section 3, is written poorly; many necessary details are omitted.
2) The use of proposed approximations is not justified

In order to be able to perform POVI in function-space, the authors use 4 different approximations in succession. The authors do not check the impact of those approximations empirically, and only assess the performance of the final procedure. I believe it would be beneficial to see the impact of those approximations on simple toy tasks where function-space POVI can be performed directly. Only two approximations are well-motivated (mini-batching and approximation of the prior distribution), whereas the translation of the function-space update and the choice of mu (the distribution, from which we sample mini-batches) are stated without any details.

Major concerns:
1) As far as I understand, one can see the translation of the function-space update to the weight-space update (2) as one step of SGD for the minimization of the MSE \sum_x (f(x; \theta^i) - f^i_l(x) - \eps v(f^i_l)(x))^2, where the sum is taken over the whole space X if it is finite, or over the current mini-batch otherwise. The learning rate of such update is fixed at 1. This should be clearly stated in the paper, as for now the update (2) is given without any explanation.

2) I am concerned with the theoretical justification paragraph for the update rule (3) (mini-batching). It is clear that if each marginal is matched exactly, the full posterior is also exactly matched. However, it would usually not be possible to match all marginals using parametric approximations for f(x). Moreover, it is not clear why would updates (3) even converge at all or converge to the desired point, as it is essentially the update for an optimization problem (minimization of the MSE done by SGD with a fixed learning rate), nested into a simulation problem (function-space POVI). This paragraph provides a nice intuition to why the procedure works, but theoretical justification would require more rigor.

3) Another approximation that is left unnoted is the choice of mu (the distribution over mini-batches). It seems to me from the definition of function-space POVI that we need to use the uniform distribution over the whole object space X (or, if we do not do mini-batching, we need to use the full space X). However, the choice of X seems arbitrary. For example, for MNIST data we may consider all real-values 28x28 matrices, where all elements lie on the segment [0,1]. Or, we could use the full space R^28x28. Or, we could use only the support of the empirical distribution. I have several concerns here:
3.1) If the particles are parametric, the solution may greatly depend on the choice of X. As the empirical distribution has a finite support, it would be dominated by other points unless the data points are reweighted. And as the likelihood does not depend on the out-of-dataset samples, all particles f^i would collapse into prior, completely ignoring the training data.
3.2) If the prior is non-parametric, f(x) for all out-of-dataset objects x would collapse to the prior, whereas the f(x) for all the training objects would perfectly match the training data. Therefore we would not be able to make non-trivial predictions for the objects that are not contained in the training set unless the function-space kernel of the function-space prior somehow prevents it. This poses a question: how can we ensure the ability of our particles to interpolate and extrapolate without making them parametric? Even in the parametric case, if we have no additional regularization and flexible enough models, they could overfit and have a similar problem.
These two concerns may be wrong, as I did not fully understand how the function-space prior distribution works, and how the function-space kernel is defined (see concern 4).

4) Finally, it is not stated how the kernels for function-space POVI are defined. Therefore, it is not clear how to implement the proposed technique, and how to reproduce the results. Also, without the full expression for the weight-space update, it is difficult to relate the proposed procedure to the plain weight-space POVI with the function value kernel, discussed in Appendix B.

Minor comments:
1) It is hard to see the initial accuracy of different models from Figure 3 (accuracy without adversarial examples). Also, what is the test log-likelihood of these models?
2) It seems that sign in line 5 on page 4 should be '-'

I believe that this could be a very strong paper. Unfortunately, the paper lacks a lot of important details, and I do not think that it is ready for publication in its current form.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJepoAru2m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Function Space Particle Optimization for Bayesian Neural Networks</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkgtDsCcKQ&amp;noteId=rJepoAru2m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper282 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper282 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper considers particle optimization variational inference methods for Bayesian neural networks.  To avoid degeneracies which arise when these algorithms are applied to the weight space posterior, the authors consider applying the approach in the function space.  A heuristic motivation is given for their algorithm and it seems to have good empirical performance.

I find the paper well-motivated and the suggested algorithm original and interesting.  As the authors mention at one point the derivation is rather heuristic, so much depends on the empirical assessment of their approach.  I was wondering if it was worthwhile to include an architecture search of some kind in the empirical comparisons in the examples?  This is because if wider than needed hidden layers are used this will worsen some of the degeneracies of the weight space posterior which could make the weight space algorithms perform worse.  Also the authors use a Gaussian process approximation in part of their algorithm and wide hidden layers make that approximation more reasonable and may advantage their approach for that reason too.  The authors discuss in Appendix B other approaches to improving weight space POVI.  I wonder also if parameter constraints would be helpful for improving the performance of the weight space methods, such as order constraints on the hidden layer biases for example to remove at least some of the sources of unidentifiability.  The authors talk in the introduction about the difficulties of exploring a complex high-dimensional posterior, the curse of dimensionality, and the limitations of current variational families but only 20 points are used to represent the posterior in the examples.   Are many more particles required to obtain good performance in more complex models and does the approach scale well in terms of its computational requirements in that sense?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Hyx6dqfunQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>This is an interesting paper that seems to make an important contribution but its technical presentation needs to be improved.

This paper proposes a new POVI method for posterior inference in BNN. Unlike existing POVI techniques that optimize particles in the weight space which often yields sub-optimal results on BNN due to its over-parameterized nature, the new POVI method aims to maintain and update particles  directly on the space of regression functions to overcome this sub-optimal issue.

NOVELTY &amp; SIGNIFICANCE:

In general, I am inclined to think that this paper has made an important contribution with very promising results but I still have doubts in the proposed solution technique (as detailed below) and am not able to converge to a final rating at this point.

TECHNICAL SOUNDNESS:

The authors claim that the new POVI technique operates directly on the function-space posterior to sidestep the over-parameterized issue of BNN but ultimately each function particle is still identified by a weight particle (as detailed in Eq. (2)). In terms of high-level ideas, I am not sure I understand the implied fundamental differences between this work and SVGD and how significant is it.

On the technical level, the key difference between the proposed work and SVGD seems to be the particle update equation in (2): The gradient flow is multiplied with the derivative of the BNN evaluated at the corresponding weight particle (in SVGD, the gradient flow was used alone). The authors then mentioned that this update rule results from minimizing the difference between f(X, theta) and f(X, theta) + \epsilon * v(f(., theta))(X). I do not follow this step -- please elaborate.

The theoretical justification that follows Eq. (3) is somewhat incoherent: What is \Epsilon(q(f(x)))? This has not been defined before or anywhere in the main text. Furthermore, the paragraph that follows the theoretical justification implies the computation of the gradient flow in (3) involves the likelihood term -- why is that?

In Algorithm 1, why do we sample from both the training set and some measure \mu? I am sure there must be a reason for this but I could not find it anywhere except for a short statement that "for convenience, we choose \mu in such a way that samples from \mu always consists a mini-batch from X". Please elaborate.

Will the proposed POVI converge?

CLARITY:

I think this paper has clarity issue with the technical exposition. The explanation tends to be very limited and even appear coherent at important points. For example, see
my 3rd point above.
