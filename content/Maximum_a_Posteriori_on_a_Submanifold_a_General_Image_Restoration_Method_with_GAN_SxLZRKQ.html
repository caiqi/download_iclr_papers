First, the motivation of the proposed framework is not convincing for me. That is, authors assumed that they have a degradation function F and all the inference process is just based on this known function. However, in real world scenarios, it is actually challenging to obtain exact degradation information. Thus we may only apply the proposed model on a few tasks with exactly known F.

Second, due to the norm based constraints, authors actually need to optimize a highly nonconvex optimization problem. Moreover, due to the trace based loss function, the computational cost will also be very high. Please notice that standard MAP based methods only need to solve a simple convex optimization model (e.g., TV) and these methods can also be applied for different restoration tasks. Actually, we only need to specify particular fidelity terms for different tasks. Moreover, very recent works have also successfully incorporate both generative and discriminative network architectures (e.g., [1,2]) into the optimization process. Therefore, I cannot find any advantage in the proposed method, compared with these existing MAP based image restoration approaches.

Finally, the experimental part is also too weak to evaluate the proposed method. As I have mentioned above, actually a lot of methods have been developed to address general image restoration tasks. Some works actually also incorporate generative and/or discriminative networks into MAP inference process for these tasks. Thus I believe authors must compare their method with these state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, authors should conduct experiments on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including natural images. This is because the digitals images in MNIST do not have rich texture and detail structures, thus are not very challenging for standard image restoration methods.

In particular, the latent variable z is optimized based on the MAP framework. And the results are obtained by G(z). This method looks reasonable to achieve good results. However, the idea is very related to Yeh et al.’s work which has already published but not mentioned at all. 

Yeh, Raymond A., et al. "Image Restoration with Deep Generative Models." 2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 2018.

Both the proposed method and Yeh et al.’s method optimize the latent variable z of the generator using MAP, although the loss functions are slightly different. In addition, the applications are very similar: image inpainting, denoising, super-resolution etc. Yeh et al.’s method should be the right baseline instead of the nearest neighbor algorithm. 

In addition, the results seem very weak. There are tons of algorithms for image inpainting, denoising, and super-resolution, but the proposed method was not compared with them. The paper claims that only the nearest neighbor algorithm can handle different degradations. This is not true. For example, total variation regularization can do all these tasks. 

Some other comments: what are the parameters of the degradation in the applications? For example, in image inpainting, does the proposed method learn the mask as well? So it is blind inpainting?

A pretrained GAN is utilized to approximate the prior distribution of the noise-free images. Then, the likelihood induces a constraint which is based on the degradation function. In particular, the method tries to find the latent point for which the GAN generates the image, which if gets degraded will match the given degraded image. Also, an optimization algorithm is presented that solves the proposed constrained optimization problem.

I find the paper very well written and easy to follow. Also, the idea is pretty clean, and the derivations are simple and clear. Additionally, the Figures 2,3 are very intuitive and nicely explain the theory. However, I think that there are some weaknesses (see comments):

Comments: 

#1) I do not understand exactly what the "general method" means. Does it mean that you propose a method, where you can just change the F, such that to solve a different degradation problem? So you provide the general framework where somebody has to specify only the F?

#2) Clearly, the efficiency of the method is highly based on the ability of the GAN to approximate well the prior distribution of the noise-free images.

#3) There are several Equations that can be combined, such that to save enough white space in order to discuss further some actual technical details. For instance, Eq. 2,3 can be easily combined using the proportional symbol, Eq. 8,9,10,11 show actually the same thing.

#4) I think that the function F has to be differentiable, and this should be mentioned in the text. Also, I believe that some actual (analytic) examples of F should be provided, at least  in the experiments. The same holds for the p(Omega). This parameter Omega is estimated individually for each degraded image?

#5) Before Eq. 8 the matrix V is a function of z and should be presented as such in the equations.

#6) I believe that it would be nice to include a magnified image of Fig. 3, where the gradient steps are shown. Also, my understanding is that the optimization goal is to find first a feasible solution, and then find the point that maximizes f. I think that this can be clarified in the text.

#7) The optimization steps seem to be intuitive, however, there is not any actual proof of converge. Of course, the example in the Figure 3 is very nice and intuitive, but it is also rather simple. I would suggest, at least, to include some empirical evidences in the experiments that show convergence.

#8) In the experiments I think that at least one example of F and p(Omega) should be presented. Also, what the numbers in Table 4 show? Which is the best value that can be achieved? These numbers correspond to several images, or to a unique image? 
#9) I think that MNIST is almost a toy experiment, since the crucial component of the proposed method is the prior modeling with the GAN. I believe that a more challenging experiment should be conducted e.g. using celebA dataset.

Minor comments:

#1) In the paragraph after Eq. 4 the equality p_r(x)=p_G(x) is very strong assumption. I would suggest to use the \simeq symbol instead.

#2) After Eq. 6 the "nonnegative" should be "nonzero".

#3) Additional density estimation models can be used e.g. VAEs, GMM. Especially, I believe that the VAE will provide a way to approximate the prior easier than the GAN.

#4) In Section 2 paragraph 2, the sentence "However, they only ... and directly" is not clear what means.

In general, I find both the proposed model and optimization algorithm interesting. Additionally, the idea is nicely presented in the paper. Most of my comments are improvements which can be easily included. The two things that make me more skeptical, is the convergence of the proposed algorithm and the experiments. The MNIST is a relatively simple experiment, and I would like to see how the method works in more challenging problems. Also, I think that additional methods to compute the image prior should be included in the experiments.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
