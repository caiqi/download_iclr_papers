In the proposed interactive parallel learning scheme, multiple identical learners with their own value-functions and policies sharing a common experience replay buffer search a good policy in collaboration with the guidance of the best policy information in the previous search interval. The information of the best policy parameter of the previous search interval is fused in a soft manner by constructing an augmented loss function for policy update to enlarge the overall search space by the multiple learners. The guidance by the previous best policy and the enlarged search space by the proposed interactive parallel learning scheme enables faster and better policy search in the policy parameter space. A working algorithm is constructed by  applying the proposed interactive parallel learning scheme to the  TD3 algorithm, and numerical results show that the constructed new algorithm outperforms most of the current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous action control.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">reinforcement learning, continuous action space RL</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Syg5AYAt27" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Potential for impact but not well framed in prior work and limited evaluation</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1eEKi0qYQ&amp;noteId=Syg5AYAt27"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper434 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper434 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper proposes a scheme for training multiple RL agents in parallel using a shared replay buffer and an objective that pulls the policies towards the best performing policy as determined by the last comparison event. The method is combined with the TD3 continuous control learning algorithm and evaluated on Mujoco tasks from OpenAI Gym.

The experiments in the paper seem correctly executed and it is nice that there are multiple baselines but I'm not convinced that the comparison is very insightful. It is somewhat odd that the architectures for the different methods differ quite a bit sometimes. The experiments are already hard to compare due to the very different natures of the optimization algorithms (distributed or not, asynchronous or not). It would be nice to also see plots of the results as a function of the number of learner steps and wall time if these can be obtained from the already executed experiments. 

The paper doesn’t include many references and fails to mention research about parallel (hyperparameter) optimization methods that seems very related, even if the goal of those methods is not always behavioral exploration. Especially Population Based Training (PBT; Jaderberg et al., 2017) is very similar in spirit in that a population of parallel learners occasionally exchange information to benefit from the findings of the best performing individuals. The method is also similar to knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), which has also been used to speed up multi-task RL (Teh et al., 2017). It would also be nice to see an ablation of some of the different components of the algorithm. For example, it would be interesting to know how important the following of the best policy is in comparison to the gains that are obtained from simply using a shared replay buffer. 

The paper is easy to follow and seems to describe the methods in enough detail to allow for a replication of the experiments. The terminology is not always precise and I’m a bit confused about whether the distance between policies is measured between their actions or their parameter vectors. Equation 8 suggests the former (as I'm assuming is what is also meant in the paper) but the text often speaks about the search radius in parameter space.

Exploration is a big problem in reinforcement learning and while parallelization of environment simulations helps to speed up training, additional computational effort typically provides diminishing returns. Methods for coordinating parallel exploration could have a severe impact. Since many RL setups are already distributed, the novelty of the paper mainly comes from sharing a replay buffer (I haven't seen this before but it seems like such an obvious thing to try that I wouldn't be surprised if it has been done) and the way in which learners are forced to follow the best individual. It is promising that the method provides the largest gains for the environment which seems to be the most challenging but it’s hard to draw conclusions from these results. It would be more insightful to see how the method performs on more challenging tasks where exploration is more important, but I understand that these experiments are computationally demanding. 

All in all, the paper presents a method that is simple while having potential for impact but needs to frame it more in the context of previous work. The empirical evaluation is a bit limited and would be more impressive with some additional tasks or at least benefit from a more thorough analysis of the settings and relative contributions of the shared replay buffer and following of the best policy.

The paper provides demonstrations in several continuous control domains.

I think this paper should be rejected because: 1) the approach is not well justified or placed within the large literature on parallel training architectures and population-based training methods, (2) the results are competitive with the best in each domain, but there are many missing details. Since the contribution is entirely support by empirical evidence, these issues need to be clarified. I look forward to the author response, as I will pose several questions below and my final score will carefully take the answers into account.

Justification of decision. There are numerous papers on parallel architectures for training deep RL systems [1,2, 6] and you cited a few, and while not all of them focus on continuous control there are design decisions and insights in those works must be relevant to your efforts. You should make those connections clear in the paper. One line of the paper is not nearly enough. The stated focus of the paper is exploration-exploitation yet there is little to no discussion of other ideas including noisy networks, intrinsic motivation, or count-based exploration methods. The paper is missing a lot of key connections to the literature.

I am certainly not a fan of architectures that assume access to many instances of the environment. In this case that assumption seems worse because of the target application: continuous control domains. These domains are simulations of physical control systems; on a robot the agent receives only one stream of experience and thus these architectures would not work well. Though there is some work on applying these multi-environment architectures to farms of robot arms; the reality of the real-world is that the arms end up being very different due to wear and tear, and engineers must constantly fix the hardware because these multi-environment architectures do not work when the environments are different. We cannot loose sight of the goal here—maximizing these simulation environments is not of interest itself, its a stepping stone—architectures that only work on simulations that afford multiple identical environments but fail in the real world have very limited application. I think this paper needs to motivate why parallel training in this way in these robotics inspired domains is interesting and worthwhile.    

The main area of concern with this paper is the experiment section. There are several issues/questions I would like the authors to address:
1) You built on top of TD3, however you just used the parameter settings of TD3 as published and didn’t tune them. This is a problem because it could just be that the existing parameter choices for TD3 were just better for the new approach. You have to take additional effort in this case to ensure your method is actually better than just using TD3. Additional parameter tuning of TD3 is required here.
2) I think its an odd choice for TD3 to have an infinite buffer, as recent work has show at least for DQN that large buffers can hurt performance [7].  Can you justify this choice beyond “the authors of TD3 did it that way”?
3) Why is R_eval different for each method?
4) Why did you not compare to TD3 on the same set of domains as used in the TD3 paper? Why a subset? Why these particular domains?
5) In 2 of the 4 domains the proposed method ties or is worse than the baselines. In half-cheetah it looks close to significant, and in the ant domain the result is unlikely to be significant because the error-bars overlap and the error-bars of TD3 are wider than the other methods so a simple visual inspection is not enough. There does not seem to be a strong case for the new method here. I may be misunderstanding the results. Help me see the significance. 
6) The paper claims improvement in variance, but this requires additional analysis in the form of an F-test of better.
7) Why these baselines (e.g., SAC) and not others? Why did you not include D4PG [6]? Soft Q-learning? A population-based training method [3,4,5,8] to name a few?

Small things that did not impact the score:
1) references to “search interval” in the abstract are confusing because the reader has not read the paper yet
2) Description of the method in abstract is too specific
3) P1 intro, not a topic sentence for what follows
4) “performs an action to its environment” &gt;&gt; grammar
5) “One way to parallel learning…” &gt;&gt; grammar
6) “that the value parameter and” &gt;&gt; grammar
7) “pitfalls” &gt;&gt; minima 
8) Did you try combining you method with other base off-policy methods? how did it work?
9) GAE undefined?
10) “among the baseline and”&gt;&gt;grammar…there are many grammar errors</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Syg0xIGX27" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Decent results but incomplete comparisons</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1eEKi0qYQ&amp;noteId=Syg0xIGX27"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper434 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">28 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper434 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper present interactive parallel exploration (IPE), a reinforcement learning method based on an ensemble of policies and a shared experience pool. Periodically, the highest-return achieving policy is selected, towards which the other policies are updated in a sense of some distance metric. IPE is applicable to any off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm. The experiments demonstrate some improvement over TD3 on four MuJoCo benchmark tasks.

The method is motivated heuristically, and and it provides some benefits in terms of sample efficiency and lower variance between training trials. However, it is hard to justify the increased algorithmic complexity and additional hyperparameters just based on the presented results. The paper motivates IPE as an add-on that can increase the performance of any off-policy RL algorithm. As such, I would like to see IPE being applied to other algorithms (e.g., SAC or DQN) as a proof of generalizability, and compared to other similar ensemble based algorithms (e.g., bootstrapped DQN).

While the improvement in the sample complexity is quite marginal, what I find the most interesting is how IPE-TD3 reduces variance between training trials compared to vanilla TD3. Convergence to bad local optimum can be a big problem, and IPE could help mitigate it. I would suggest including environments where local optima can be a big problem, for example HumanoidStandup, or any sparse reward task. Also the paper does not include ablations, which, given the heuristic nature of the proposed method, seems important.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
