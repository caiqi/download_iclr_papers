Nevertheless, this type of experiments require estimating mutual information and entropy which becomes intractable for moderately large problems.
In this work we propose an experimental framework for understanding SGD based only on the output labels of ANNs.
We look at SGD learning as a trajectory in the space of probability measures and define a notion of shortest learning path using a total variation metric.
Using this formulation we provide a connection between learning and Markov processes that allows us characterize the trajectory of information theoretic quantities during learning.
In addition, a simple Markov chain model for SGD learning, that moves along the shortest learning path is constructed and compared  with SGD through empirical simulations.
Experiments show that SGD moves in a similar trajectory as a Markov chain along the shortest learning path.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Stochastic gradient descent, Deep neural networks, Entropy, Information theory, Markov chains, Hidden Markov process.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We look at SGD as a trajectory in the space of probability measures, show its connection to Markov processes, propose a simple Markov model of SGD learning, and experimentally compare it with SGD using information theoretic quantities. </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Byg9ksJZaQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>unclear motivation</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkMON20ctX&amp;noteId=Byg9ksJZaQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1465 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">08 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1465 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">In summary, this paper does the following:
- The initial problem is to analyze the trajectory of SGD in training ANNs in the space of  P of probability measures on Y \times Y. This problem is interesting, but difficult. 
- the paper constructs a Markov chain that follows a shortest path in TV metric on P
(the \alpha SMLC)
- through experiments, the paper shows that the trajectories of SGD and \alpha-SMLC have  similar conditional entropy. 

My issues with this paper are:
a/ The main result is a simulation. How general is this? Could it depend on the dataset? Could you provide some intuition or prove that for certain dataset, these two trajectories are the same (or very close)? 
b/ Meaning of this trajectory. This is not the trajectory in P, it is the trajectory of the entropies. In general, is there an intuitive explanation on why these trajectories are similar? And what does it mean -- for example, what would be a possible implication for training SGD? Could it be that all learning methods will have this characteristic parabolic trajectory for entropies? 
c/ The theoretical contribution is minor: both the techniques and results quoted are known. 

Overall, I think the paper lacks a take-away. It is an interesting observation that the trajectory of \alpha-SMLC  is similar to that of SGD in these plots, but the authors have not made a sufficient effort to interpret this.

This paper was inspired by (Ziv and Tishby 17'), but instead of measuring the mutual information I(X;T) and I(Y:T), this paper proposed to measure H(\hat{y}) and H(\hat{y}|y), which are much easier to compute but carries similar meaning as I(Y;T) and I(X;T).

The interesting part of this paper appears in Section 4, where the author makes a connection between the SGD training process and \alpha-SMLC(strong Markov learning chain). SMLC is just simply linear combination of the initial distribution and the final stable distribution of the labels. The authors show that the trajectory of the real experiment is similar to that of SMLC.

Generally I think the paper is well-written and clearly present the ideas. Here are some pros and cons.

Pros 1: The trajectory presented in this paper is much more reliable than that in (Ziv and Tishby 17'), since measuring the entropy and conditional entropy of discrete random variables are much easier. Also it is easy for people to believe that the trajectory holds for various neural network structure and various activation functions.

Pros 2: The connection to SMLC is interesting and it may contain lot of insights.

Cons 1: One of my major concern is --- if you look at the trajectory of the experiment v.s. SMLC (Figure 3), they look similar at first glance. But if you look at it carefully, you will notice that the color of them are different! For SGD, the trajectory goes to the turning point very soon (usually no more than 10% of the training steps), whereas SMLC goes to the turning point much slower. How do the authors think about this phenomenon and what does this mean?

Cons 2: This paper is going to be more meaningful if the author can provide some discussions, especially about (1) what does the shape trajectory mean (2) what do the connection between the trajectory and Markov chain means (3) how can these connections be potentially useful to improve training algorithm? I understand that these questions may not be clearly answerable, but the authors should make this paper more inspiring such that other researchers can think deeper after reading this paper.

Cons 3: I suggest the authors using SGD instead of GD throughout the paper. Usually GD means true gradient descent, but the paper is talking about batched stochastic gradient descent. GD does not have Markovity.

Generally, I think the paper is on the borderline. I think the paper is acceptable if the author can provide more insights (against Cons 2).</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJlBFC6EjQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Results of questionable value</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkMON20ctX&amp;noteId=BJlBFC6EjQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1465 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">17 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1465 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper tries to describe SGD from the point of view of the distribution p(y',y) where y is (a possibly corrupted) true class-label and y' a model prediction. Assuming TV metric of probabilities, a trajectory is defined which fits to general learning behaviour of distributions.

The issue is that the paper abstracts the actual algorithm, model and data away and the only thing that remains are marginal distributions p(y) and conditional p(y'|y). At this point one can already argue that the result is either not describing real behavior, or is trivial. The proposed trajectory starts with a model that only predicts one-class (low entropy H(y') and high conditional entropy) and ends with the optimal model. the trajectory is linear in distribution space, therefore one obtains initially a stage where H(y') and H(y'|y) increase a lot followed by a stage where H(y'|y) decrease.

This is known to happen, because almost all models include a bias on the output, thus the easiest way to initially decrease the error is to obtain the correct marginal distribution by tuning the bias. Learning the actual class-label, depending on the observed image is much harder and thus takes longer. Therefore no matter what algorithm is used, one would expect this kind of trajectory with a model that has a bias.

It also means that the interesting part of an analysis only begins after the marginal distribution is learned sufficiently well. and here the experimental results deviate a lot from the theoretical prediction. while showing some parabola like shape, there are big differences in how the shapes are looking like.

I don't see how this paper is improving the state of the art, most of the theoretical contributions are well known or easy to derive. There is no actual connection to SGD left, therefore it is even hard to argue that the predicted shape will be observed, independent of dataset or model(one could think about a model which can not model a bias and the inputs are mean-free thus it is hard to learn the marginal distribution, which might change the trajectory)

 Therefore, I vote for a strong reject.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">2: Strong rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
