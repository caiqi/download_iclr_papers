While existing work addresses random and class-dependent label noise, we focus on feature dependent label noise, which is ubiquitous in real-world data and difficult to model. Two elements distinguish our approach from others: 1) instead of relying on the original feature space, we employ an autoencoder to learn a discriminative representation and 2) we introduce an energy-based formalism for the label correction problem. We prove that a discriminative representation can be learned by training a generative model using a loss function comprised of the difference of energies corresponding to each class. The learned energy value for each training instance is compared to the original training labels and contradictions between energy assignment and training label are used to correct labels. We validate our method across eight datasets, spanning synthetic and realistic settings, and demonstrate the technique's state-of-the-art label correction performance. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions to show the effect of label noise on the gradients of empirical risk.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">label noise, feature dependent noise, label correction, unsupervised machine learning, semi-supervised machine learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We show how to learn a discriminative representation using an energy based semi-supervised model and we show how to use it to correct input dependent label noise of various types on several datasets.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SkllgyZWaX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Need more theoretical guarantee</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyxu6oAqYX&amp;noteId=SkllgyZWaX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper818 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">08 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper818 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper addresses Type III label noise correction problem in which the labeling noise depends on the features. They assume that we can obtain a small amount of cleanly labeled data, and use an energy-based semi-supervised learning approach to bootstrap the relabeling process. 

Pros:
- Problem is well-motivated with a reasonably good overview of this research area. 
- Paper is generally well-written with enough details to follow and good experimental result discussion.

Cons:
- The energy-based approach based on contrastive divergence is pretty straightforwardly defined, but it will make the paper much stronger if the authors can have more analysis on this approach and/or provide theoretical guarantee on generalization. 
- It is not obvious to me how to extend the proposed approach to multi-class problems. 
- It will be beneficial to test the approach on more real-world problems on top of the toy-data-alike binary classification problems. 

Minor clarification questions: 
- What amount of cleanly labeled data is sufficiently required for the proposed approach to work? The authors have some pre-selected percentage in experiments but it is non-trivial to establish that for different applications.
- Related to the previous comment, how much clean data were used in AE (known) columns in all experiments? 
- In Fig 2 between the two subgraphs, why is the left one showing positive thetas while the right one showing negative thetas?
- Were the hyperparameters a &amp; b chosen from cross-validation or from std of E terms in all experiment results? 
- In Table 1, for Breast Cancer dataset, how can AE (known) be better than the upper-bound LR-C? 
- It would be good to vary the noise parameters and show how robust the proposed approach is in dealing with different levels of noise. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1eT2iLan7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Need improvements</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyxu6oAqYX&amp;noteId=S1eT2iLan7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper818 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper818 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Need improvements

[Summary]

This paper addresses the problem of correcting noisy labels for binary classification. It assumes the exists of fully clean data, trains an energy-based autoencoder using contrastive learning objective, and use the estimated energy to determine if a training label is corrupted or not. 

[Pros]

1.	The paper summarizes different types of label noise in a sensible way. And, it is reasonable to bootstrap the learning process with a small fully clean dataset.
2.	The proposed method shows encouraging results under controlled noise.

[Cons]

1.	It is not well-motivated why a contrastive objective or an energy-based autoencoder can be a good solution for label correction. In particular, the connections are not established between the discriminative feature learned by an energy-based model and the label correctness. The proposed method looks more like a binary classifier with a better-regularized structure, but still, it is unclear why an energy-based autoencoder is a good choice. 
2.	The proposed method is limited to binary classification, and there is no obvious way to extend it to multiple classes. 
3.	The experiments are on toy/small-scale datasets with controlled label noise (but the way to control the noise is not clear). To show the effectiveness of the proposed methods, experiments need to be done on larger-scale datasets with truly realistic unknown noise, Establishing state-of-the-art classification accuracy using a large-scale dataset with noisy labels can serve as strong support for this paper.

We also agree with the reviewer that appropriate assumptions are made in setting up the problem of label noise correction. 

To address some of the authors remarks, we would like to highlight that the existing method can use a small dataset that has clean labels to facilitate the label correction process. However, as shown in tables 1, 2 and 3 (see column AE learned), one does not need to start with clean labels. Using the method of Ding et al. (2018), clean labels can be inferred on a subset of the data before bias correction step is applied.

Reviewer: “It is not well-motivated why a contrastive objective or an energy-based autoencoder can be a good solution for label correction. In particular, the connections are not established between the discriminative feature learned by an energy-based model and the label correctness. The proposed method looks more like a binary classifier with a better-regularized structure, but still, it is unclear why an energy-based autoencoder is a good choice.”

The authors agree that this should be explained more clearly in the paper (appropriate changes to follow). The following illustrates the motivation of the contrastive loss and the energy interpretation: 
Consider the case when noise is only in one class and the other class is noise free. Then, one could train an autoencoder (with standard reconstruction loss) to become accurate at reconstructing samples from the noise free class. Once the autoencoder learned weights have been set, it can be used to process the noisy class (where some of the labels are incorrect). Then, one would expect that the miss-labelled instances will have low reconstruction loss (i.e. low energy), which has been inferred using an unsupervised approach (i.e. autoencoder with reconstruction loss) instead of taking a fully supervised approach. This is because the features of these mis-labelled instances actually correspond to the features that were used to train the original autoencoder.  Our contrastive loss guarantees that the loss will be large for samples that are not from the noise free class in the above example. That is, the negative sign in front of the second term in equation (5) ensures that the energy will be large for the second class. As such the first term in equation (5) should correspond to the class that has the most clean samples out of the two classes (as mentioned in ). In summary, the connection to label noise is that the energy value indicates whether ambiguous samples (i.e. samples with unreliable labels) have features that are similar to the class corresponding to term 1 of equation (5). 

To address another one of the reviewer’s comments, we would like to mention that our approach may extend to multiclass scenarios by constructing a one-vs-all scheme. In this paper, we aim to augment literature for label correction in binary classification.

Reviewer: "The experiments are on toy/small-scale datasets with controlled label noise (but the way to control the noise is not clear). To show the effectiveness of the proposed methods, experiments need to be done on larger-scale datasets with truly realistic unknown noise, Establishing state-of-the-art classification accuracy using a large-scale dataset with noisy labels can serve as strong support for this paper."

Towards this end, we include the Arrhythmia dataset results (Table 1, last row) and the MNIST dataset with label noise as studied by Ren et al. (2018). The Arrhythmia dataset consists of 50000 samples and the problem posed - of algorithmically assigned labels - remains relevant to real world tasks such as web annotation. This dataset contains real label noise as discussed in the paper. Next, we compare our method with another state-of-the-art noise robust algorithm (Ren et al. (2018)) on a relatively large dataset: MNIST.

Intuitively, the authors claim that contradictions between energy and noisy labels can be used to identify label noise. To make the idea reliable, the authors propose to compute the energy by using learned (commonly shared) features. Experiment results look good. The presentation is also clear. My concerns are as follows:

(1) By learning discriminative features and then correcting the label noise, the authors have implicitly assumed that the label noise strongly dependent on the discriminative features. This assumption may be strong as most labels are provided according to the original instance (features). In the experiment section, it is very unclear about how the noise is generated, e.g., how to select x_i according to variance? How to set the threshold? What is "col" in Tables 1 and 2? What are the overall label noise rates? Note that if the threshold for the variance is large. It means that the noise is only added to the discriminative features, making the experiment too ad-hoc. 

(2) The theory of why the residual energy can be used to identify label noise is elusive. How to set the threshold for identifying label noise with a theoretical guarantee is also unclear. Two recent papers on learning with instance-dependent label noise are surprisingly missed, e.g., Menon, Aditya Krishna, Brendan Van Rooyen, and Nagarajan Natarajan. "Learning from binary labels with instance-dependent corruption." arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.00751 (2016). and Cheng, Jiacheng, et al. "Learning with Bounded Instance-and Label-dependent Label Noise." arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.03768 (2017). The latter one proposes algorithms to identify label noise with theoretical guarantees. The authors should compare the proposed method with them.

(3) There are methods provided for choose the values of hyperparameters. Most of them are empirically set, which is not convincing.

(4) The authors reported that with discriminative features learned by employing noisy data, the proposed method also provide good performance. It would be interesting to see how corrected labels will recursively help better learn the discriminative features. Illustrating figures are preferred.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
