Summary:

This paper studies the convergence properties of loss-aware weight quantization with different gradient precisions in the distributed environment, in which servers keeps the full-precision weights and workers keeps quantized weights. The authors provided convergence analysis for weight quantization with full-precision, quantized and quantized clipped gradients. Specifically, they find that: 1) the regret of loss-aware weight quantization with full-precision gradient converge to an error related to the weight quantization resolution and dimension d. 2) gradient quantization slows the convergence by a factor related to gradient quantization resolution and dimension d. 3) gradient clipping renders the speed degradation dimension-free. 

Comments:

Pros:

- The paper is generally well written and organized. The notation is clean and consistent. Detailed proofs can be found in the appendix, the reader can appreciate the main results without getting lost in details.

- The paper provides theoretical analysis for the convergence properties of loss-aware weight quantization with full-precision gradients, quantized gradient and clipped quantized gradient, which extends existing analysis beyond full-precision gradients, which could be useful for distributed training with limited bandwidth. 

Cons:

- It is unclear what problems the authors try to solve. The problem is about gradient compression, or how the gradient precision will affect the convergence for training quantized nets in the distributed environment, in which workers have limited computation power and the network bandwidth is limited. It is an interesting setting, however, the author does not make it clear the questions they are asking and how the theoretical results can guide the practical algorithm design. 

- The authors mentioned that quantized gradient slows convergence (relative to using full-precision gradient) in contribution 2 while also claims that quantizing gradients can significantly speed up training of quantized weights in contribution 4, which is contradictory to each other.

- It is not clear what relaxation was made on the assumptions of f_t in section 3.1. The analysis are still based on three common assumptions: 1) f_t is convex 2) f_t is twice differentiable 3) f_t has bounded gradients. The assumptions and theoretical results may not hold for non-convex deep nets. E.g., the author does not valides the theorems results on d with neural networks but only with linear models in section 4.1.

- The author demonstrate training quantized nets in the distributed environment with quantized gradients, however, no comparison is made with other related works (e.g., Wen et al, 2017). 

Questions: 

- Theorem 1 is an analysis for training with quantized weights and full-precision gradients, which is essentially the same setting as BinaryConnect. Similar analysis has been done in Li et al, 2017. What is the difference or connection with their bound?

- It is not clear how gradienta are calculated w.r.t. quantized weights on worker, is straight through estimator (STE) used for backpropagation through Q_w?

- In section 3.3, why is \tilde{g}_t stochastically quantized gradient? How about statiscally quantized gradients?

- Why do the authors use linear model in section 4.1? Why are the solid lines in Figure 3 finished earlier than dashed lines? For neural networks, a common observation is that the larger the dimension d, the better the generalization performance. However, Figure 3 and Theorem 1 seem to be contradictory to this common belief. Would it possible to verify the theorem on deep nets of different dimension?

- Why does the number of worker affect the performance? I failed to see why the number of workers affect the performance of training if it is a synchronized distributed training with the same total batch size. After checking appendix C, I think it is better to discuss the influence of batch sizes rather than the number of workers.

- Why is zero weight decay used for CIFAR-10 experiment but non-zero weight decay for imagenet experiment? How was weight decay applied in Adam for quantized weights? 

Minor issues: 
- The notation of full-precision gradient w.r.t quantized weights in Figure 1 should be \hat{g}_t, however, g_t is used.

------

The authors proposes an analysis of the effect of simultaneously quantizing the weights and gradients in training a parametrized model in a fully-synchronized distributed environment, using RMSProp training updates.

The authors provide a theoretical analysis in term of regret bound, when the objective functions are smooth, convex and gradient-bounded wrt the parameter. They also assume that the parameters remains in a compact space. Their conclusions are as follow (thm 1, 2 and 3):

- weight quantization, which is deterministic and therefore introduces a bias in the objective functions, introduces a non-vanishing term in the average reget, that depens on the quantization error, where the vanishing term decreases in O(d /sqrt(T)).

- gradient quantization, which is performed in a stochastic, unbiased way (wrt to the full-precision gradient) do not introduce a further non-vanishing term, but augments the constant factor in the vanishing term.

- gradient clipping onto gradient quantization reduced this constant factor, at the cost of ntroducing a further non-vanishing term in the average regret.

An experimental setting is performed to assess how much the theoretical conclusions derived ina simpe setting apply to predictive functions parametrized with neural-network. The experiments are three folded:
- a first toy experiment with convex objective validates the theoretical findings
- a second experiment performed on CIFAR assess the performance on a grid of weight/gradient quantization with or without gradient clipping
- a third experiement, that is profiled (synthetically) assesses the performance of wieght/gradient quantization when training a model on imagenet.

In conclusion, the authors observe that quantizing weight/gradients systematically lead to a slight decrease in performance but provides promising improvement in term of training speed

Review
------

The paper is well written, documented and well-sectioned, with well written theoretical guarantees and thorough experiments, including one on a large dataset. The theoretical guarantees are relatively non-surprising and their proofs are indeed little involved. The authors are yet the first to analyse the effect of biased weight quantization on one hand, and of gradient clipping on the other hand.

The reviewer would have appreciated further comparison with existing analysis, in particular a comparison between stochastic weight quantization and loss-aware deterministic weight quantization. The bias introduced by the latter seems the culprit in the reduction of predictive performance. What if we applied non-biased weight quantization, with stochastic quantized gradient ?

The experiments as presented are a little underwhelming: first of all, there is no report of training time on ImageNet, and I believe that the profiling as been made in a communication model and not in a real setting. It would be great to see the best training time that you achieve by weight/gradient quantization (say on 4 bits).

Moreover, it appears that even with 4 bit quantization, the test accuracy of the trained model is significantly reduced. Why not increase the size to say 6 or 8 bits ? 

On a related aspect, can the communication quantization be used jointly with a forward/backward quantized evalution ?

Overall, although this paper is relatively incremental and has underwhelming experiments, it is a thorough work that is worthy of being presented at ICLR 2019, in the reviewer's opinion.

Following existing literature, the authors propose to discretize the parameters in a manner that limits its impact on the loss function by means of a diagonal approximation of the Hessian. This also means that one can bound the difference between the gradient for the full precision parameter and the gradient for the discretized parameter.  In contrast, they discretize the gradients stochastically so that the discretized version is an unbiased estimator of the full precision stochastic gradient. Since the stochastic gradient is itself an unbiased estimator of the gradient, this means we are dealing with an estimator whose variance has increased in a manner we can bound as well. The theoretical analysis consists in pushing these two bounds through classical analyses of the stochastic gradient algorithm, in this case, a regret-based version in the style of Zinkevich or Duchi.  Although i did not check the minute details of the proof, the argument feels correct and familiar.  They also give an interesting result in favor of clipping gradients, worth developing.

Although the title promises an analysis that holds for deep networks, this analysis strictly applies only to convex models. The author argue that the predictions made by this analysis also apply to deep networks, and support this argument with extensive experiments (which certainly represent a fair amount of work).  This result is believable but should not be construed as an analysis. Nevertheless, both results (the theoretical result for convex model and the empirical result for deep networks) are interesting and worth sharing.

The main caveat comes from the style the parallel learning algorithm they are considering.  In the data-parallel case (which they consider), parameter servers approaches have been displaced by setups where all workers update their copy of the weights using the allReduced gradients.  One could also use discretized gradients to speedup the allReduce operation (this is less of a win because latencies dominate) but this would only result in an increased variance and a much simpler analysis.

Finally I am not completely up-to-date with this line of work and cannot evaluate the novelty with confidence. This was not known to me, which is only a piece of evidence.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rygZhkSRiQ" class="note panel trashed"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title">  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryM_IoAqYX&amp;noteId=rygZhkSRiQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">[Deleted]</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper190 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
