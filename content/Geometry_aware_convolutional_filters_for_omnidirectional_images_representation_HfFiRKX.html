The images captured by such cameras, are often analyzed and classified with techniques designed for planar images that unfortunately fail to properly handle the native geometry of such images. That results in suboptimal performance, and lack of truly meaningful visual features. In this paper we aim at improving popular deep convolutional neural networks so that they can properly take into account the specific properties of omnidirectional data. In particular we propose an algorithm that adapts convolutional layers, which often serve as a core building block of a CNN, to the properties of omnidirectional images. Thus, our filters have a shape and size that adapts with the location on the omnidirectional image. We show that our method  achieves better results compared to existing deep neural network techniques for omnidirectional image classification. Finally we show that our method is not limited to spherical surfaces and is able to incorporate the knowledge about any kind of omnidirectional  geometry inside the deep learning network.

It solves the problem of distorsions introduced by the projection of such images by replacing convolutions by graph-based convolutions, with in particular a combinaison of directed graphs which makes the network able to distinguish between orientations.

The paper is fairly well written and easy to follow, and the need for treating omnidirectional images differently is well motivated. However, since the novelty is not so much in the graph convolution method, or in the use of graph methods for treating spherical signals, but in the combined application of the particular graph method proposed to the domain of omnidirectional images, I would expect a more thorough experimental study of the merits of the method and architectural choices.

1. The projected MNIST dataset looks very localized on the sphere and therefore does not seem to leverage that much of the global connectivity of the graph, although it can integrate deformations. Since the dataset is manually projected, why not cover more of the sphere and allow for a more realistic setting with respect to omnidirectional images?
More generally, why not use a realistic high resolution classification dataset and project it on the sphere? While it wouldn't allow for all the characteristics of omnidirectional images such as the wrapping around at the borders, it would lead to a more challenging classification problem. Papers such as [Khasanova &amp; Frossard, 2017a] have at least used two toy-like datasets to discuss the merits of their classification method (MNIST-012, ETH-80), and a direct comparison with these baselines is not offered in this work.

2. The method can be applied for a broad variety of tasks but by evaluating it in a classification setting only, it is difficult to have an estimate of its performance in a detection setting, where I would see more uses for the proposed methods in such settings (in particular with respect to rotationally invariant methods, which do not allow for localization).

3. I fail to see the relevance of the experiments in Section 4.2 for a realistic application. Supposing a good model for spherical deformations of a lens is known, what prevents one from computing a reasonable inverse mapping and mapping the images back to a sphere? If the mapping is non-invertible (overlaps), then at least using an approximate inverse mapping would yield a competitive baseline.
I am surprised at the loss of accuracy in Table 2 with respect to the spherical baseline. Can you identify the source of this loss? Did you retrain the networks for the different deformations, or did you only change the projection of the network trained on a sphere? 

4. While the papers describes what happens at the level of the first filters, I did not find a clear explanation of what happens in upper layers, and find this point open to interpretation. Are graph convolutions used again based on the previous polynomial filter responses, sampling a bigger region on the sphere? Could you clarify this?

5. I would also like to see a study of the choice of the different scales used (in particular, size of the neighborhood).

Overall, I find that the paper introduces some interesting points but is too limited experimentally in its current form to allow for a fair evaluation of the merits of the method. Moreover, it leaves some important questions open as to how exactly it is applied (impact of sampling/neighborhood size, design of convolutions in upper layer...) which would need to be clarified and tested.

Additional small details:
- please do not use notation $\mathbb{N}_p$ for the neighborhood, it suggests integers
- p. 4 "While effective, these filters ... as according to Eq. (2) filter..." -&gt; article missing for the word "filter"

Overall, the idea is interesting and the authors propose an extrinsic way to respect the underlying geometry by using tangent space projection. Understanding the graph construction and filter definition is not easy from the text description. It would be better to use a figure to illustrate them. 

1) How to define the size of the circular area on the tangent plane? 

2) Will the filter change greatly with the definition of the weight function in the neighborhood? Since the point locates on the sphere, why not using the geodesic distance instead of the Euclidean distance? 

3) It would be better to directly define the filter on the sphere and make it be intrinsic. The same filter on the tangent space may cover different sizes of regions on the sphere; while we prefer the filter has consistent coverage on the sphere. 

4) The paper misses the discussion and comparison to Anisotropic CNN (ACNN) and mixture model network (moNet).

The method is based on graph convolutional networks, and in contrast to previous work, is applicable to other geometries than spherical ones (e.g. fisheye cameras). Since standard graph CNNs are unable to tell left from right (and up from down, etc.), a key question is how to define anisotropic filters. This is achieved by introducing several directed graphs that have orientation built into the graph structure.

The paper is fairly well written, and contains some new ideas. However, the method seems ad-hoc, somewhat difficult to implement, and numerically brittle. Moreover, the method is not equivariant to rotations, and no other justification is given for why it makes sense to stack the proposed layers to form a multi-layer network. 

The results are underwhelming. Only experiments with small networks on MNIST variants are presented. A very marginal improvement over SphericalCNNs is demonstrated on spherical MNIST. I'm confused by the dataset used: The authors write that they created their own spherical MNIST dataset, which will be made publicly available as a contribution of the paper. However, although the present paper fails to mention it, Cohen et al. also released such a dataset [1], which raises the question for why a new one is needed and whether this is really a useful contribution or only results in more difficulty comparing results. Also, it is not stated whether the 95.2 result for SphericalCNNs was obtained from the authors' dataset or from [1]. If the latter, the numbers are not comparable.

The first part of section 3.2 is not very clear. For example, L^l is not defined. L is called the Laplacian matrix, but the Laplacian is not defined. It would be better to make this section more self contained.

In the related work section, it is stated that Cohen et al. use isotropic filters, but this is not correct. In the first layer they use general oriented spherical filters, and in later layers they use SO(3) filters, which allows anisotropy in every layer. Estevez et al. [2] do use isotropic spherical filters.

In principle, the method is applicable to different geometries than the spherical one. However, this ability is only demonstrated on artificial distortions of a sphere (fig 3), not practically relevant geometries like those found fisheye lenses.

In summary, since the approach seems a bit un-principled, does not have nice theoretical properties, and the results are not convincing, I recommend against acceptance of this paper in its current form.

In [1], the first intrinsic CNN-like architecture was proposed for manifolds, further extended in [2-4]. In particular, in [2-3] anisotropic convolution filters on manifolds/meshes were proposed. In [6], anisotropic diffusion was extended to general graphs using graph motifs.

Thank you very much for the detailed comments. We are well aware of most of these works and their general relation to our proposal in terms of using geometry in the deep learning context. We, however, believe that these works focus on a different problem than ours, namely the one of 3D structure processing. In this paper, we rather propose a new approach to process omnidirectional images, where the challenge is to use the knowledge about image distortion in order to create effective representations. As deep networks suffer from interpretability, there is no straightforward way to incorporate this knowledge to the learning process. Therefore, our contribution is in suggesting an effective way of building several directed graphs to make the filters aware of the geometry of omnidirectional images. Of course, the sphere can be considered as a specific 3D structure - we rather argue that, if the geometry of images is known and fixed, it can be incorporated right away in the learning algorithm, instead of using generic learning solutions.

Nevertheless, as this might lead to confusion, we will extend our related work by including a subsection about the relation between other geometrical graph-based approaches and our convolutional filters for omnidirectional images, We will specifically highlight the differences between these families of methods. Below we briefly summarise these differences. 

The method of [1] propose to define a patch around each point on a manifold using polar system of coordinates. Further, [2,3] propose different ways of constructing such patches on point clouds. The works [2,3] are in spirit similar to our approach in that they aim at creating anisotropic filters that operate on graphs. However, from the methodological perspective they are quite different, as they require computing eigendecomposition in order to model position- and direction-dependent filters, which is a time consuming process. The methods of [1,2,3] were generalised in the work [4], where the authors suggest defining a local system of d-dimensional pseudo-coordinates for every point and learn both the filters and patch operators that work on these coordinates, rather than using fixed kernels. Further, the authors of [5] propose edge-based convolutional kernels and dynamic graph updates. While being flexible and effective for general tasks these methods do not directly take the advantage of the knowledge of the projective geometry that we have in the specific context of the omnidirectional images considered in our work. Instead, we propose to model this a priori knowledge using a specifically designed graph representation. We further introduce a new way of creating such a representation and incorporating it inside a neural network for effective representation learning. 

A different method was suggested by [6], where the authors propose to process the directed graph by exploiting local graph motifs, which represent its connectivity patterns. The main differences of this method with our work are that first, this method assumes that the directed graph is already given. In our problem, building such a graph that is able to fully take advantage of the image projective geometry is actually one of the main contributions. Second, the approach in [6| does not use the knowledge of the coordinate system associated with omnidirectional images, which we however use in our architecture, in order to define filter orientations.

Overall, they are truly key differences between the cited works and ours, which provides a constructive solution for the specific case of omnidirectional images. We will do our best to clarify it in the final version of the paper however.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div></div></main></div>
