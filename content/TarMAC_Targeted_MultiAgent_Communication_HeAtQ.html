In this scenario, learning an effective communication protocol is key. We propose a communication protocol that allows for targeted communication, where agents learn \emph{what} messages to send and \emph{who} to send them to. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage communication approach where the agents co-ordinate via several rounds of communication before taking an action in the environment. We evaluate our approach on several cooperative multi-agent tasks, of varying difficulties with varying number of agents, in a variety of environments ranging from 2D grid layouts of shapes and simulated traffic junctions to complex 3D indoor environments. We demonstrate the benefits of targeted as well as multi-stage communication. Moreover, we show that the targeted communication strategies learned by the agents are quite interpretable and intuitive.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Targeted communication in multi-agent cooperative reinforcement learning</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">4 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_HklTK_ChTX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>How is communication targeted when each agent is receiving messages sent by all other agents and then deciding how much importance to give to each agent's message?</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1e572A5tQ&amp;noteId=HklTK_ChTX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures"><a href="/profile?id=~Akshat_Agarwal1" class="profile-link">Akshat Agarwal</a></span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">17 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1383 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper claims that the agents choose who to send messages to, however from Figure 1 and Section 4 it appears that each agent outputs a message=&lt;signature,value&gt; which is sent to ALL agents, who then use dot-product attention to give more or less weight (or importance) to messages from certain agents. So, each agent receives a message from all other agents, and then uses attention to aggregate these messages (instead of just taking a mean as done in CommNet, Sukhbaatar et al. 2016). Can you please elaborate on how the communication is targeted?

Another point: in 'VAIN: Attentional Multi-agent Predictive Modeling' (Hoshen 2017, published in NIPS 2017), each agent uses a similar attention mechanism to aggregate messages from other agents (however it uses an exponential kernel function instead of dot-product). Apart from the particular form of attention, can you please elaborate on the difference between your work and VAIN?</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJgU41z93X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting extensions for multi-agent communication, it misses some baselines to illustrate the benefits of the contribution.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1e572A5tQ&amp;noteId=BJgU41z93X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1383 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1383 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors present a multi-agent communication architecture where, agents can use targeted communication and can perform multiple communication steps. The paper is well written and easy to follow.

Comments:

1) The idea of multi-stage communication is great, but the paper doesn't have a strong point to support this contribution. Could the authors illustrate the benefit of multi-stage e.g. vs. the communication channel width?

2) In DIAL, the authors introduce a "null" action, what is the difference of that and multi-stage?

3) It is not clear to the reader what is the contribution of targeted communication vs. non-targeted as it looks a solution to the mean-pooling. Could the authors include at least one more experiment with on an architecture that doesn't use mean pooling. From an architecture perspective there is a scalability benefit of using pooling, but if that's the only one it has to be made more clear.

In this architecture each message consists of a key and a value. When receiving the message the listener produces an attention key that is used to selectively attend to some messages more than other using soft attention. This differs from the typical 'broadcasting' protocols learned in literature. 

Questions / Comments: 
- Eqn (4) looks like a vanilla RNN. Did you experience any issues around exploding or vanishing gradients when doing multiple rounds of communication? Why not use a gated architecture here? 
- "Centralized Critic" section: This equation is from the COMA paper, ie. a centralised critic with policy gradients rather than DDPG. What did you use for the variance reduction baseline to estimate the advantage? Also, did you try conditioning the critic on the central state rather than the concat of observations? Formally this is required for the algorithm to be convergent. 
- How many independent seeds are the results averaged over? 
- The attention mechanism seems to provide very little value across all experiments: 
-- 84.9% vs 82.7% 
-- 89.5% vs 89.6% 
-- 64.3% vs 68.9% 
Did you check if any of these numbers are significant? This is my single biggest concern with the paper. Currently it's unclear whether attention is required at all in the settings presented. It would be good to see eg. the TarMAC 2-stage on the traffic junction (97.1%) ablated without attention.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1xvVXP_nm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Paper review</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1e572A5tQ&amp;noteId=S1xvVXP_nm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1383 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">01 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1383 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors present a study on multi-agent communication.
Specifically, they adapt communication to be targeted and multi-staged.
Experiments on  2 synthetic datasets and 1 3D visual dataset confirm that both additions are beneficial

Overall, this paper was somewhat clear and more importantly includes experiments on House3D, a more realistic dataset.

My main concern is the following: the method is not about targeting, but about selectively hearing.
If agents are sharing the reward then why should targeted communication be beneficial at all? Isn't the optimal strategy to just communicate everything to everyone? I understand that they should be selective at the listening side to properly integrate only the relevant information (so, attend over all received messages), but why should we expect the speaker to apriori know who this message should go to? Moreover, I don't really understand how targeted communication can even work (in the way the authors explain it) since the agents have partial information (e.g., in shapes they only see 5x5 around them), so they don't really know who is where --  but I could potentially see this working should the agents put information about their own identity and location.  So, given the positive results that the authors get, my understanding is that the signature doesn't have information about who should the recipient of the information be but more about what where the properties of the sender of this information.  So, based on my understanding, I don't feel that the flow of the story quite matches what is really happening and this might be very confusing for prospective readers. Can the authors elaborate on this, aim i getting things wrong?

There is literally no information about model size (or at least I wasn't able to find any). Is there any weight-sharing across agents? Do you obtain CommNets by using the implementations of the authors or by ablating the signature-part of your model? Moreover, why do agents have a limited view window on the SHAPES -- is (targeted) communication redundant when agents have full observability? The part about how multi-staged communication is implemented is quite cryptic at the moment -- is multi-staged the fact that the message is out-putted by processing with a recurrent unit? The messages is factorized into two parts k and u leading to a vector of size D -- what happens should we have one message of size D (rather than factorizing into 2), something like this would control for any improvements obtained from increases the parameters of the model.

Finally,  if the premises of the paper is to define more effective communication protocols, evident in the use of continuous communication, (rather than studying what form can multi-agent communication etc etc), a necessary baseline  (especially in cases where agents share reward), is to communicate the full observation (rather than a function of it).  This baseline is not presented here and it's absolutely necessary.
