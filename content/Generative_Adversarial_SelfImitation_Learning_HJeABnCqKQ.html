Instead of directly maximizing rewards, GASIL focuses on reproducing past good trajectories, which can potentially make long-term credit assignment easier when rewards are sparse and delayed. GASIL can be easily combined with any policy gradient objective by using GASIL as a learned reward shaping function. Our experimental results show that GASIL improves the performance of proximal policy optimization on 2D Point Mass and MuJoCo environments with delayed reward and stochastic dynamics.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SJgYyP5hhm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>No comparison/evaluation on discrete action tasks (i.e. ATARI games)</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJeABnCqKQ&amp;noteId=SJgYyP5hhm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1589 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">04 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1589 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">[Paper Summary]:
This paper proposes a regularization technique for existing RL algorithms by encouraging them to learn to reproduce the best past trajectories which obtained higher reward than that of current policy. The proposed method in the paper has the same high-level idea as "Self-imitation learning" [Oh et.al. ICML 2018] with a different objective. Instead of performing imitation learning to distill the knowledge from past best trajectories, this proposes to use inverse reinforcement learning via GAIL objective [Ho and Ermano, 2016]. The best k trajectories from past experience are stored to train a discriminator which is then used to augment the external reward function with a discriminator reward.

[Paper Strengths]:
The paper combines ideas from GAIL and self-imitation learning to propose a method that leverages past best trajectories via inverse-RL. This combination allows one to interpret self-imitation of best trajectories as a mechanism for "reward shaping" where learned discriminator shapes the environmental reward using past experiences. This is an exciting perspective and needs further discussion.

[Paper Weaknesses and Clarifications]:
=&gt; This paper is very closely related to self-imitation learning [Oh et.al.], however, there is no theoretical justification provided (unlike [Oh et. al.]) whether the policy learned by optimizing Equation-11 is in anyway related to the optimal policy -- which was the case as shown in [Oh et.al.]. That being said, this is not a requirement for a paper to show theoretical justification as long as the paper justifies given approach with ample empirical evidence.
=&gt; The main comparison point for the proposed approach, "GASIL", is "SIL" [Oh et.al.]. This paper provides a good comparison on continuous control tasks on Mujoco where "GASIL" performs slightly better than "SIL" in 3 out of 6 environments. However, "SIL" [Oh et. al.] showed extensive experiments on all Atari Games + Mujoco tasks. Since the proposed approach is mainly empirically motivated, the experiments should at least show a comparison on all the environments of the closely-related prior work. It would be much more convincing to see a bar chart across all 48 Atari Games showing relative improvement of "GASIL" over "SIL", as shown in Figure-4 of [Oh et. al.].
=&gt; Other concerns:
    - The paper mentions on multiple occasions that the proposed method would handle delayed and "sparse" reward. However, it is not clear how can past best trajectories help with "sparse" rewards ("delayed-dense-rewards" seems alright, but they are not the same as "sparse"!). For instance, suppose the agent gets only terminal-reward in a maze. In such a case, the agent would need to rely on some form of exploration bonus (count-based, curiosity etc.) to reach the sparse-goal even once.
    - What prevents the learned policy from over-fitting to the local minima of the "locally" best trajectories seen so far?

[Final Recommendation]:
I request the authors to address the comments raised above. The paper has good potential, but sufficient empirical evidence is needed to justify the proposed technique. If the results on all Atari games can be included and shown to improve over "SIL", I would update my final rating.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1elPtU53m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Good natural algorithm but significance and understanding of when to apply is unclear.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJeABnCqKQ&amp;noteId=H1elPtU53m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1589 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1589 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary:

This paper proposes a self-imitation learning technique which modifies GAIL such that top-k trajectories with high reward found by the agent are kept in a buffer (and updated as learning goes on) such that the discriminator tries to distinguish between trajectories generated by the generator and those in the buffer while the generator tries to fool the discriminator by trying to imitate trajectories present in the buffer. 

Experiments are shown on two domains: 1. a simple 2D domain where the agent must avoid orange circles (negative reward) and touch green and blue circles which yield positive reward and 2. on MuJoCo against PPO and variants of PPO as baselines where it is shown that GASIL performs better (even under increased stochastic noise in the dynamics.)


Comments:

- Generally well-written and easy to understand. Thanks!!

- Intuitive algorithm and good experiments with ablation studies on MuJoCo.  

- My main concern is that the paper while offering a good self-imitation algorithm fails to really shine light on when/why this is expected to work. Especially in the following natural areas:

a. Why is it that performance decreases as buffer size B increases?
b. Why doesn't the policy get stuck imitating the first few good trajectories? the conjecture offered is that policy gradient strongly encourages greedy myopic behavior while GASIL does not. Wouldn't one expect GASIL to suffer more?
c. Does GASIL work better on rich observation spaces (e.g. Atari games) as well?

Without good answers (theoretical or empirical) to the above questions it is a bit hard to assess how significant of an improvement GASIL actually is and what is the prescription for using this over non-GAIL style self-imitation learning algorithms?</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Syelg-g92X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>combination of GAIL and self-imitation learning, but not convincing</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJeABnCqKQ&amp;noteId=Syelg-g92X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1589 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1589 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper presents an incremental extension to the Self-imitation paper by Oh, Junhyuk, et al. The previous paper combined self-imitation learning with actor-critic methods, and this paper directly integrates the idea into the generative adversarial imitation learning framework.

I think the idea is interesting, but there remains some issues very unclear to me. In the algorithms, when updating the good trajectory buffer, it is said "We define ‘good trajectories’ as any trajectories whose the discounted sum of rewards are higher than that of the policy". What does "that of the policy" mean? How do you know the reward of the policy?

Second, without defining good trajectories, I don't think Algorithm 1 would work. Algorithm ` 1 misses the part of how to update buffer B. After introducing their own algorithm, the author did not provide much solid proof or analysis for why this self-imitation learning works.

In the experiment section, the author implemented GASIL for various applications and presented reasonable results and compared them with other methods. Nevertheless, without theoretical proof, it is hardly convincing that the results could be consistently reproduced instead of being merely accidental for some applications.
