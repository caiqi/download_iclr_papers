Without considering the uneven distribution of information in the corrupted images, previous methods are restricted by local convolutional operation and equal treatment of spatial and channel-wise features. To address this issue, we design local and non-local attention blocks to extract features that capture the long-range dependencies between pixels and pay more attention to the challenging parts. Specifically, we design trunk branch and (non-)local mask branch in each (non-)local attention block. The trunk branch is used to extract hierarchical features. Local and non-local mask branches aim to adaptively rescale these hierarchical features with soft attentions. The local mask branch concentrates on more local structures with convolutional operations, while non-local attention considers more about long-range dependencies in the whole feature map. Furthermore, we propose residual local and non-local attention learning to train the very deep network, which further enhance the representation ability of the network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, demosaicing, compression artifacts reduction, and super-resolution. Experiments show that our method achieves comparable or better results compared with recently leading methods. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Non-local network, attention network, image restoration, residual learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">New state-of-the-art framework for image restoration</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1lKz511pQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>excellent application oriented paper; new state-of-the-art results; yet limited novelty</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkeGhoA5FX&amp;noteId=B1lKz511pQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper693 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper693 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors propose a residual non-local attention net (RNAN) which combines local and non-local blocks to form a deep CNN architecture with application to image restoration.

The paper has a compact description, provides sufficient details, and including the appendix has an excellent experimental validation.

The proposed approach provides top results on several image restoration tasks:  image denoising, demosaicing, compression artifacts reduction, and single image super-resolution.

The main weakness of the paper is the limited novelty, as the proposed design builds upon existing ideas and concepts. However, up to some point all the new ConvNet designs can be seen as incremental developments of the older ones, yet they are needed for the progress of the field.

I would suggest to the authors the inclusion of related works such as:
Timofte et al., "NTIRE 2018 Challenge on Single Image Super-Resolution: Methods and Results", CVPRW 2018
Wang et al., "A fully progressive approach to single-image super-resolution", CVPRW 2018
Note that DIV2K dataset was introduced in:
Agustsson et al., NTIRE 2017 Challenge on Single Image Super-Resolution: Dataset and Study, CVPRW 2017

also, the more recent related works:

Also, I would like a response from the authors on the following:
Why not using dilated convolutions instead of or complementary with the mask branch or other design choices from this paper?

# Results
The strongest point of the paper is that the quantitative and qualitative image restoration results appear to be very good, although they seem almost a bit too good.


# Novelty
I'm not sure about the novelty of the paper, but I suspect it to be rather incremental. The paper says "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to consider residual non-local attention for image restoration problems." Does that mean non-local attention (in a very similar way) has already been used, just not in a residual fashion? If so, that would not constitute much novelty. I have to admit that I'm not familiar with the related work on attention, but I did not understand *why* the results of the proposed method are supposed to be much better than that of previous work.


# Clarity
I think the paper is not self-contained enough, since it seems to implicitly assume substantial background knowledge on attention mechanisms in CNNs. 

Furthermore, the introduction of the paper identifies three problems with existing CNNs that I don't necessarily fully agree with. None of these supposed problems are backed up by (experimental) evidence.

I don't think it is sufficient to just show superior results than previous methods. It is also important to disentangle why the results are better. However, the presented ablation experiments are not very illuminating to me.

The attempts at explaining what the novel attention blocks do and why they lead to superior results are very vague to me. Maybe they are understandable in the context of related work, but I found many statements, such as the following, devoid of meaning:
- "Without considering the uneven distribution of information in the corrupted images, [...]"
- "However, in this paper, we mainly focus on learning non-local attention to better guide feature extraction in trunk branch."
- "We only incorporate residual non-local attention block in low-level and high-level feature space. This is mainly because a few non-local modules can well offer non-local ability to the network for image restoration."
- "The key point in mask branch is how to grasp information of larger scope, namely larger receptive field size, so that itâ€™s possible to obtain more sophisticated attention map."


# Experiments
- The experimental results are the best part of the paper. However, it would've been nice to include some qualitative results in the main paper.
- The proposed RNAN model is trained on a big dataset (800 images with ~2 million pixels each). Are the competing methods trained on datasets of similar size? If not, this could be a major reason for improved performance of RNAN over competing methods. At least in the appendix, RNAN and FFDNet are compared more fairly since they are trained with the same/similar data.
- The qualitative examples in the appendix mostly show close-ups/details of very structured regions (mostly stripy patterns). Please also show some other regions without self-similar structures.


# Misc
- Residual non-local attention learning (section 3.3) was not clear to me.
- The word "trunk" is used without definition or explanation.
- Fig. 2 caption is too short, please expand.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BJx1ow5K2X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Technical contribution is not high, but good performing approach on several image restoration tasks</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkeGhoA5FX&amp;noteId=BJx1ow5K2X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper693 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper693 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">- Summary
This paper proposes a residual non-local attention network for image restoration. Specifically, the proposed method has local and non-local attention blocks to extract features which capture long-range dependencies. The local and non-local blocks consist of trunk branch and (non-) local mask branch. The proposed method is evaluated on image denoising, demosaicing, compression artifacts reduction, and super-resolution.

- Pros
  - The proposed method shows better performance than existing image restoration methods.
  - The effect of each proposed technique such as the mask branch and the non-local block is appropriately evaluated.

- Cons
  - It would be better to provide the state-of-the-art method[1] in the super-resolution task. 
    [1] Y. Zhang et al., Image Super-Resolution Using Very Deep Residual Channel Attention Networks, ECCV, 2018.
  - The technical contribution of the proposed method is not high, because the proposed method seems to be just using existing methods.
  - The contribution of the non-local operation is not clear to me. For example, how does the global information (i.e., long-range dependencies between pixels) help to solve image denoising tasks such as image denoising?

Overall, the technical contribution of the proposed method is not so high, but the proposed method is valuable and promising if we focus on the performance.
