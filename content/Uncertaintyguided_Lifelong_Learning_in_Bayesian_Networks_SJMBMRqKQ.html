In this lifelong learning setting a single model is challenged to learning a new task, while at the same time not forgetting about previous tasks and freeing up capacity for future tasks. We argue that the ability to identify network parameters which are most critical for a learned task plays a critical role to decide which ones to remember. In this work we propose to rely on Bayesian Networks, which inherently model the distribution of a parameter rather than a single value of a parameter.  More specifically, we formulate lifelong learning in the Bayesian-by-Backprop framework, exploiting the parameter uncertainty for two lifelong learning directions. First, weight pruning, where a hard selection is made on which parameters to select per task and, second, weight regularization which can be seen as a softer version to keep important parameters, respectively.  We show the benefit of our approach using diverse object classification datasets in both cases.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">lifelong learning, continual learning, sequential learning</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We formulate lifelong learning in the Bayesian-by-Backprop framework, exploiting the parameter uncertainty in two settings: for pruning network parameters and in importance weight based continual learning.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Syl6wT6qnm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Good motivation, minor contributions in term of algorithms</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMBM2RqKQ&amp;noteId=Syl6wT6qnm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1264 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1264 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Motivated from leveraging the uncertainty information in Bayesian learning, the authors propose two algorithms to prevent forgetting: Pruning and Regularization. Experiments on several sequential learning tasks show the improved performance.

Quality:  The description on the related work is comprehensive. The proposed algorithms seem easy to follow. 
 
Clarity: Low 

The contributions in terms of algorithms are clearly presented. However, the writing can be largely improved.

(1) Some claims are improper:  I don't think it's accurate to say that most of lifelong learning is non-Bayesian (In introduction), and EWC is derived from a Bayesian perspective, and Variational Conditional Learning is a very Bayesian approach.

(2) Please proofread the submission: 
Typos: e.g.,  "Beysian", "citestochastic methods";  
Style: x is not bold occasionally, but has the meaning given the context. 

Originality: It seems to be the first work that leverages the variance in Bayesian Neural Nets (BNN) to prevent forgetting. My understanding that EWC also consider the variance, but in a different way. 

Significance: 
It is good to consider variance/uncertainty for lifelong learning, and should be encouraged.
However, the comparison to the representative algorithms or state-of-the-art is missing in this submission. For example, EWC/IS, or method in [*].  Is it possible to run the experiments on more standard datasets, such as [*].

[*] Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting with Hard Attention to the Task, ICML 2018


Questions:
1. In (6), there are three terms on the right side, it seems the 2nd term include the 3rd term, why do we need to add the 3rd term again?

2. "Once a task is learned, an associated binary mask is saved which will be used at inference to recover key parameters to the desired task. The overhead memory caused by saving the binary mask (less than 20MB for ResNet18), is negligible given the fact it completely eliminates the forgetting"

To me, saving a binary mask means saving "partial" model. First, this is additional parameter saving. Second, in the inference stage, one can recover the corresponding best model using the mask, how close is it to cheating? (Perhaps I am not an expert in lifelong learning). 
Can you put the model size of ResNet18, so that the readers can understand 20MB is small/negligible compared to the full model.

Authors propose a method that prevents catastrophic forgetting typical for naive application of stochastic gradient descent by preventing supposedly important weights to change (in either soft of hard manner), where the weight importance is assessed by its signal to noise ratio estimated from the corresponding (approximate) posterior distribution.
Authors evaluate their approach on a set of image classification datasets and find it superior to the PackNet baseline as well as few simpler ones.

The idea of using uncertainty estimates obtained from Bayesian training to adjust weight updates is natural and potentially very promising. 
However, to me this paper does not seem to investigate the idea sufficiently deep.

The weight pruning or hard masking variant of the method depends on a very important hyperparameter p (size of the mask) which is unclear how to set beforehand. 

I also struggle with understanding the weight regularisation or soft masking variant. 
Authors seem to get their inspiration in the idea of assumed density filtering, where the posterior for 1:T-1 is approximated and used a prior for task T (last sentence on page 5).
At the same time, in Algorithm 2, line 6 the prior is defined as the standard BBB mixture prior and not the approximate posterior from the previous task.
Quite oddly, parameters of the _approximate posterior_ are being quadratically regularalized to not deviate from parameters of the _approximate posterior_ from the previous task. 
This deviates from the original idea and requires additional justification.
Besides that, I find the way this regularisation is applied potentially problematic for the variance parameter (last term in eq. 6).
Here authors apply the regularisation to the parameter of the softplus transformation they use, but scale it with the inverse std deviation which is the “classical” parametrisation. The choice of parametrisation was not discussed, however, clearly different parametrizations may lead to very different results. 

On the experimental side, I have two major issues:
1. The datasets considered are very small, authors could consider using ImageNet, especially given that they already work with 224x224 images.
2. The only prior work used as a baseline is PackNet, while there is no reason why other established methods such as EWC are not applicable.

Minor comments:
The middle expression in eq. 5 seems to miss the -log p(D_T | D_{1:T-1}) term which does not change the latter expression (since it does not depend on parameters theta).
Page 3: “citestochastic methods”, a citation seems to be missing.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1l2REPYh7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Nice combination of ideas, but requires more development.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJMBM2RqKQ&amp;noteId=B1l2REPYh7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1264 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1264 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">In this paper, a framework for lifelong learning based on Bayesian neural network is proposed. The key idea is to combine iterative pruning for multi-task learning along with the weight regularization. The idea of iterative pruning was first considered by Mallya et al., 2018 and weight regularization was considered for Bayesian neural network by Nguyen et al., 2018.

Pros: 
- Combination of two idea seems novel. I like the idea of considering the weight parameter as the "global" random variables and the mask parameters as the task-specific random variables. 

Cons: 
- In general, there is lack of explanation/justification on the combination of two ideas. Especially, there is lack of explanation on how to apply the whole algorithm (e.g., text states that complete algorithm is in Algorithm 3., but there is no Algorithm 3. in the paper). 

- I do not understand how equation (6) is developed, and why hyper-parameters are need for "regularization of weights", comparing with the Variational Continual Learning (VCL, Nguyen et al., 2018). More explanation seems necessary for justification of the algorithm.

- More stronger baselines need to be considered for the experiments. Why is there no comparison with the existing continual learning algorithms? At the very least, comparison with the VCL or Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC, Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) seems necessary since one of the key idea is about regularization for weights.


In general, I think it is a nice idea to combine two existing approaches. However, the algorithm lacks justification in general and experimental results are not very persuasive.   </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></main></div>
