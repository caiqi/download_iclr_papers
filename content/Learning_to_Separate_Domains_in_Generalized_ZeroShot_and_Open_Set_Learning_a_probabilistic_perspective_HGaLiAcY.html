Such a problem exists in many previous recognition tasks, such as Open Set Learning (OSL) and Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (G-ZSL), where the testing instances come from either seen or novel/unseen classes of different probabilistic distributions. Previous works focused on either only calibrating the confident prediction of classifiers of seen classes (W-SVM), or taking unseen classes as outliers. In contrast, this paper proposes a probabilistic way of directly estimating and fine-tuning the decision boundary between seen and novel/unseen classes. In particular, we propose a domain division algorithm of learning to split the testing instances into known, unknown and uncertain domains, and then conduct recognize tasks in each domain. Two statistical tools, namely, bootstrapping and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test, for the first time, are introduced to discover and fine-tune the decision boundary of each domain. Critically, the uncertain domain is newly introduced in our framework to adopt those instances whose domain cannot be predicted confidently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieved the state-of-the-art performance on OSL and G-ZSL benchmarks.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Generalized zero-shot learning, domain division, bootstrapping, Kolmogorov-Smirnov</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value"> This paper studies the problem of domain division problem by segmenting instances drawn from different probabilistic distributions.  </span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">7 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_BkljyQb63X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>a paper with a good potential but difficult to read and missing recent baselines</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GaLiAcY7&amp;noteId=BkljyQb63X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper218 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">05 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper218 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper deals with the difficult problem of novelty recognition which is the core issue in open set learning and generalized zero-shot learning. Indeed a method able to separate samples between known and unknown domains in these settings would clearly indicate the direction for their solution. The idea proposed here consists in starting from the extreme value theory and then using bootstrapping to model the confidence score for a sample of belonging or not to a certain class. Through a probabilistic evaluation (based on K-S test) on the trustworthy of each category classifiers, the domain separation is extended to consider also an uncertain domain and the separation threshold is progressively refined. Once the domains are separated, classification can be performed disjointly in each of them.

+ Having a way to define known/unknown and uncertain samples on the basis of which one can
then proceed to solve OSL and GZSL sounds as a very effective strategy. Moreover, all the parts of the method are 
based on reliable probabilistic principles.
 
- Unfortunately the text is not easy to read. There are several repetitions and disordered lists (same numbers used multiple times or mixing names and numbers for the items) which distract the reader. As a side note, it would be better to avoid mentioning dataset names without their description and definition ('aPY' appears out of the blue in the introduction). 

- The experiments extends over different datasets and the ablation study is valuable. However to understand how the proposed method advances over the current state of the art it is important to consider and discuss the most recent publications  on OSL and GZSL. See for instance
Open Set Learning with Counterfactual Images, ECCV 2018

The authors apply these techniques to two general recognition problems: open-world recognition, and Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL). Experimental results are given on a variety of datasets, and a thorough comparative evaluation on GZSL is performed.

The paper has the following strong points:

 1. The motivations for each element of the proposed approaches are fairly well presented and are compelling.
 
 2. The experimental results on GZSL are impressive, especially compared to established approaches.

The paper also has the following weak points:

 1. The writing is a bit rough throughout, though not to extreme distraction. The abstract starts right off with the awkward "This paper studies the problem of domain division problem..." The manuscript needs more careful revision for clarity.

 2. Related to the previous point, there are several elements of the technical exposition that are lacking in clarity. For example, it is unclear what eq. 9 is defining exactly. It seems to be the final decision rule, but it is not clear how seen, unseen, and uncertain samples are determined. Algorithm 1 is clear, but there is never a clear, complete definition of the end-to-end decision pipeline given. I feel like it would be difficult to reproduce the results of this article without significant trial-and-error.

 3. The authors seems to have relied on the Xian et al. paper to extract data for their comparative evaluation on GZSL. There are more recent works from 2018 that should be included, such as:

 Arora, Gundeep, Vinay Kumar Verma, Ashish Mishra and Piyush Rai. “Generalized Zero-Shot Learning via Synthesized Examples." CVPR 2018.

In summary, this paper has many interesting ideas, and the GZSL results are indeed impressive (with respect to the results in the comparison). However, there are many problems with clarity and missing, recent work in the comparative evaluation.

The approach handles test samples estimated to be from the seen class in one way, and ones that belong to either the unseen or uncertain domain in another way. This idea handles the problem that test instances may incorrectly be attributed to one of the seen classes. The authors evaluate their approach on several relevant datasets against a wide variety of methods for OSL and ZSL, and show convincing results. 

I have three concerns. One is that the method sections of the paper are fairly lengthy, including an extensive explanation of prior work, e.g. EVT, so time is spent reading before the reader gets to the interesting part of the proposed method, and this time could be better focused around the contributions of *this* work. 

For the G-ZSL experiments, most of the methods seem to be older methods tackling ZSL not G-ZSL so perhaps more relevant baselines could be found.

On a related note, it would be good to include some qualitative examples that might reveal some intuitive reasons for the large margin between the performance of the proposed work, and other approaches; in some cases this margin seems rather large, and while the authors attempt to explain it, something beyond a textual explanation might be useful. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SyleQWiIsQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Weak comparison</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GaLiAcY7&amp;noteId=SyleQWiIsQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">19 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper218 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">It is interesting to see the paper is handling more realistic and challenging problem, i.e., G-ZSL.

1. Here it will be more interesting to see the ZSL result also. Can you include the result of ZSL also?
— As you mentioned, our main contribution is the domain division part. The ZSL result only depends on the mapping we mentioned, which we do not highlight. Thus, we did not report the ZSL results. Actually, the result of this simply mapping is very close to the state-of-the-art (AWA 73.3; aPY 46.8; CUB 39.6) with much fewer computation resources. This kind of simple mapping can prove the efficacy of the domain division algorithm. 

2. The main contribution of the paper are G-ZSL, there is a lot of recent work handling this problem, but the author has not compared with any recent work of G-ZSL. Can you discuss and compare a few recent works of G-ZSL.
— Admittedly, all of the works you mentioned are very interesting and promising, however, they all synthesize the pseudo-instances in the target domain, which is distinct from previous methods. But these works are complementary and potentially useful to our works. As we said, our mapping based on very simple and classic algorithms, in order to emphasize the meaning of domain division. Moreover, the works you mentioned are also likely to be enhanced by our division algorithm, which reflects the adaptability of our work. 
— Additionally, although our work is not accuracy-oriented, our results are still promising in some datasets, like AWA (Ours: 67.3; Verma et al.: 61.5; Felix et al.: 60.2; Xian et al.: 59.6).</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rygw026YoX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Reply</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1GaLiAcY7&amp;noteId=rygw026YoX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">(anonymous)</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">21 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper218 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Thanks for your reply.

I found this work is very interesting and appreciate the work, but my point is you have to mention the current state-of-art.

1- Just my point was in the table-2 you have taken all the competitor that results are far below than yours. You have taken max H-mean 27 (ALE) while current state-of-art is ~60. 
2- It's true that recent work on the G-ZSL is synthesizing the example, but this is a way of solving the problem, you can't say they are synthesizing the example, and I am not so I will not mention their result.
3- Also in the case of CUB dataset current state-of-art has H-mean ~60, while in the table you have shown the best competitor result ~34.

Thanks! We just check several papers you recommended. However, we didnot find the reporte H-mean of 60. It would be very nice if you could point out the paper. We will refere this paper. We also want to emphasize several points,
(1) The whole paper aims at  Learning to Separate Domains in Generalized Zero-Shot and Open Set Learning: a probabilistic perspective. The focus is on domain division algorithm from a probabilistic perspective. So we only use linear model for zero-shot learning parts (rather than design a bit "heavy" zero-shot learning algorithm); and we show that even by using such a simple model, our model still works very well (thanks to well separating the sevearl domains). Of course, designing a good ZSL/G-ZSL is also an extra-ordinary work, which nevertheless would be enough to make an independent paper.
(2) Admittedly, in some datasets, our model has slightly inferior results, and yet our results are generally good on most of dataset. Thus the results show the efficacy of proposed models, since again we actually use very simple forms in the recognition parts.

2,Discussion about synthesis instances.
Yes, it's really a brillant point of employing synthesis instances to solve the task, since it seems like a "free lunch". We actually mean that the works of using synthesis instances for Open-Set/ZSL/G-ZSL are orthogonal but potentially useful to our works. Thanks again for mentioning it.
