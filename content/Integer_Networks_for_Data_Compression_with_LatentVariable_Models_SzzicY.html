For such models to produce a compressed binary sequence, which is the universal data representation in a digital world, the latent representation needs to be subjected to entropy coding. Range coding as an entropy coding technique is optimal, but it can fail catastrophically if the computation of the prior differs even slightly between the sending and the receiving side. Unfortunately, this is a common scenario when floating point math is used and the sender and receiver operate on different hardware or software platforms, as numerical round-off is often platform dependent.

In order to range code the (floating point) latent representations into bit-strings for practical data compression, both the sender and receiver of the binary channel must have identical instances of the prior despite non-deterministic floating point arithmetic across different platforms. The authors propose using neural networks that perform integer arithmetic (integer networks) to mitigate this issue.

Pros:
- The problem statement is clear, as well as the approach taken to addressing the issue.
- Section 5 did a nice job tying together the relevant literature on using latent variable models for compression with the proposed integer network framework.
- The experimental results are good; particularly, Table 1 provides a convincing case for how using integer networks remedies the issue of decompression failure across heterogeneous platforms.

Cons:
- In Section 3, it wasn’t clear to me as to why the authors were using their chosen gradient approximations with respect to H’, b’ and c’. Did they try other approximations but empirically find that these worked best? Where did the special rescaling function s come from? Some justifications for their design choices would be appreciated. 
- The authors state in Section 2 that the input scaling is best determined empirically -- is this just a scan over possible values during training? This feels like an added layer of complexity when trying to train these networks. It would be nice if the authors could provide some insight into exactly how much easier/difficult it is to train integer networks as opposed to the standard floating point architectures.
- In Section 6, the authors state that the compromised representational capacity of integer networks can be remedied by increasing the number of filters. This goes back to my previous point, but how does this “larger” integer network compare to standard floating point networks in terms of training time?

Regarding the questions raised:
- Indeed, the approximations we present here are the end result of a long list of experiments. Our experiments included:
  - Several different gradient substitutes such as straight-through, tanh, etc.
  - Replacing the gradient of the activation functions vs. adding uniform noise as a substitute of the quantization during training.
  - A distillation approach (i.e. first training a floating point compression model, and then attempting to match an integer model to it in terms of a simpler loss function).
  - We considered a post-hoc quantization approach, but did not end up experimenting with it much due to the complexity of its implementation.

- We found that the presented solution is the best performing, while being conceptually simple and relatively easy to implement. Of course, we cannot claim that this solution is optimal in any sense. Optimizing fully discrete models is a hard problem. To our knowledge, our method is the first attempt to solve the non-determinism problem of neural networks in this context, and certain choices were made in an ad-hoc way. However, we hope that it can be used as a baseline for improved methods in the future.

- We agree we should have been more elaborate explaining how some of the choices were made. We improved the paper in this regard.
  - The rescaling function s is designed to maximize usage of the dynamic range of kernel coefficients. It simply rescales the kernels such that the minimum or maximum coefficient of each filter is identical to one of the dynamic range bounds, but keeps zero at zero.
  - The function r is a reparameterization of the divisor c, such that for small values of it, the effective descent step size on it is reduced. When c is small, large perturbations in c can lead to excessively large fluctuations of the quotient (i.e., the input to the nonlinearity). This leads to instabilities in training. The reparameterization ameliorates this. The effective step size on c ends up being multiplied with a factor that is approximately linear in c (this is previous work; see Ballé, 2018).
  - We did not conduct a lot of experiments regarding the choice of input scaling. We believe it doesn’t matter too much; in our experiments, we simply chose a value “by eye”, so that the tanh nonlinearity is reasonably well represented with the lookup table. (I.e., in figure 2, right panel, we made sure that at least two or three input values are mapped to each output value, in order to preserve the approximate shape of the nonlinearity.)

- We found in all of our experiments that integer networks tend to train somewhat slower than floating point networks. When matching floating point and integer networks for asymptotic performance, integer networks take longer to converge (likely due to their larger number of filters). When matching by number of filters, it appears that the training time is about the same, but the performance ends up worse, of course. We have added a figure to the paper to show this.

The authors propose what amounts to an integer version of Balle 2018, and demonstrate that it allows for transmission between platforms without catastrophic errors due to numerical round-off differences.

The paper (and problem) is of low significance, but the authors present a neat solution.

Pros:
- Well defined problem and solution.
- Practical question relating to use of ANNs for data en/de-coding.

Cons:
- Presentation needs brushing up: e.g. why give two examples for H, b, v bit widths?
- Some approximations are not well motivated or justified.  E.g. why is it valid to replace gradient of a function that has 0 gradients with the identity?
- Paper needs some rewriting for clarity.  E.g. where is the kernel K defined?
- Lack of experimentation to justify the fact that the construction of (16) leads to instabilities, and is therefore less suitable than the method outlined here.

However, we fundamentally do not understand the reasoning for the rejection. We think that all of the “cons” provided represent minor issues which can be fixed, and we address them further below.

As such, only the claim that our paper is of “low significance” remains as a potential reason for the rejection. We disagree with that assessment, for the following reasons:

- Application-orientedness: Indeed, our paper addresses a problem relevant to using variational models for compression, which is an “application” of neural networks. However, numerous “application” papers are submitted to ICLR every year. We do not think that compression as such is any less important than, say, natural language processing.

- Generality: More importantly, we are not presenting “yet another compression method”. Our method for achieving machine determinism is relevant and applicable to all latent variable models. This includes some of the state of the art models for learned compression.

- Optimality: We cannot guarantee that our method is optimal, or the only solution to this problem, for that matter. This is due to the nature of the problem (optimizing fully discrete models is hard). However, as far as we know, this problem has never been addressed before in a learning context or in this generality. It does not represent incremental work, but a qualitative contribution. The fact that there now exists a first documented solution to this problem, which can be used as a baseline for future work, is a strong point for qualifying our paper.

We hope that the reviewer will respond to this and clarify what exactly is the reason for their rejection. We do not think we understand the reasoning at this point.

Regarding the other points made:

- We give two examples for the bit widths, because they show how the relevant parameters can be chosen in conjunction with different activation functions. We talk about this in the following paragraphs. We do not understand why the reviewer thinks that giving two examples for something constitutes bad quality.

- Replacing the gradient of a quantization function (i.e. round()) with the identity is not a new idea (see, for example, Theis (2017), which we cite, among many others). If the reviewer would like a justification, how about the following:
Taking the gradient of round() yields a sum of Dirac delta distributions, i.e.,
d/dx round(x) = sum_i delta(x-i). Obviously, this gradient function is not going to be helpful for optimization, because it will produce too much variance in the gradients (+infinity for the half-integer positions, and 0 everywhere else). However, a smoothed version of it is helpful. If we convolve this gradient function with a triangle function (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_function," target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_function,</a> which can be seen as the generator function for linear splines) to smooth it, the result is a constant (1), which corresponds to the identity function when used in backpropagation.

- K is not a kernel, but the bit-width of the kernel (the kernel itself is defined as H). K is defined right after equation (7), where it is first mentioned. We modified the language to distinguish better between the kernel and its bit width. However, we believe that given sufficient time and care, any reader should have been able to distinguish this from the context.

- We have to push back on the claim that we did not conduct enough experiments leading up to our conclusion that (16) causes instabilities. In fact, our initial goal was to simply reuse (16), since it had been already published and is simpler. However, the results were consistently worse, and on further inspection, we observed that the prior and the encoder would always end up in a kind of oscillatory behavior. We will try to find a visualization of this for the final paper. Theis (2017) used Gaussian scale mixtures centered on 0 as the prior, which is a form of regularization and might have helped reduce this, as it would prevent arbitrary shifts. However, we would like to be able to use arbitrarily powerful priors, as is generally the goal in variational approximation. The combination of (17) and (18) is unfortunately slightly less simple to implement, but it has the benefit that the prior distribution need not be subjected to regularization, and thus enables a more general solution. So, this choice was not only informed by empirical results, but also by the desire to be able to do without regularization.

As a result, a model run on a different hardware or software than the one on which it was trained could completely fail due to numerical rounding-off issues. This problem has been considered in various papers, however, the classification task was mainly discussed. In this paper, on the other hand, the authors present how the numerical rounding-off issue could be solved in Latent-Variable Models (LVM).

In order to cope with the numerical rouding-off issue, the authors propose to use integer networks. They consider either quantized ReLU (QReLU) or quantized Tanh (Qtanh). Further, in order to properly train the integer NN, they utilize a bunch of techniques proposed in the past, mainly (Balle, 2018) and (Balle et al., 2018). However, as pointed out in the paper, some methods prevent training instabilities (e.g., Eqs. 18 and 19). All together, the paper tackles very important problem and proposes very interesting solution by bringing different techniques proposed for quantized NNs together .

Pros:
+ The paper is well-written.
+ The considered problem is of great importance and it is rather neglected in the literature.
+ The experiments are properly carried out.
+ The obtained results are impressive.

Cons:
- A natural question is whether the problem could be prevented by post-factum quantization of a neural network. As pointed out in the Discussion section, such procedure failed. However, it would be beneficiary to see an empirical evidence for that.
- It would be also interesting to see how a training process of an integer NN looks like. Since the NN is quantized, instabilities during training might occur. Additionally, its training process may take longer (more epochs) than a training of a standard (float) NN. An exemplary plot presenting a comparison between an integer NN training process and a standard NN training process would be highly appreciated.
- (Minor remark). The paper is well-written, however, it would be helpful to set the final learning algorithm. This would drastically help in reproducibility of the paper.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">7: Good paper, accept</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJeSLLtxAm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Response to AnonReviewer1</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1zz2i0cY7&amp;noteId=rJeSLLtxAm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper690 Authors</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">20 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper690 Official Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">We thank the reviewer for their notes and constructive comments.

Regarding the remarks made:

- We considered a post-hoc quantization approach, but did not end up experimenting with it much due to the complexity of its implementation. Simply quantizing the kernels and activations to an arbitrary choice of global quantization step size yielded terrible results (not even close to competitive – the model simply failed). We believe a solution which tries to maximize usage of the dynamic range of both the kernel coefficients and the activations, such as ours, can perform better, because it minimizes the quantization error throughout the network. In a post-training quantization approach, the actual range of activations would need to be measured empirically, and then a solution to a set of complex constraints would need to be found. We did not attempt this, because our goal was to come up with a method that requires only a minimum of post-training modifications to the model.

- We agree that a training plot is a useful addition to the paper and have added one. We found that integer networks tend to train somewhat slower than floating point networks. When matching floating point and integer networks for asymptotic performance, integer networks take longer to converge (likely due to their larger number of filters). When matching by number of filters, it appears that the training time to convergence is roughly the same, but the performance ends up worse, of course. Indeed, the training loss also appears somewhat noisier.

- We will try to add a summary of the method to the final paper.
