We describe a method for denoising the hidden state during training to achieve more robust representations thereby improving generalization performance. Attractor dynamics are incorporated into the hidden state to `clean up' representations at each step of a sequence. The attractor dynamics are trained through an auxillary denoising loss to recover previously experienced hidden states from noisy versions of those states. This state-denoised recurrent neural network (SDRNN) performs multiple steps of internal processing for each external sequence step. On a range of tasks, we show that the SDRNN outperforms a generic RNN as well as a variant of the SDRNN with attractor dynamics on the hidden state but without the auxillary loss. We argue that attractor dynamics---and corresponding connectivity constraints---are an essential component of the deep learning arsenal and should be invoked not only for recurrent networks but also for improving deep feedforward nets and intertask transfer.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">recurrent nets, attractor nets, denoising, sequence processing</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">We propose a mechanism for denoising the internal state of an RNN to improve generalization performance.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Bye5F_Hb6Q" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting use of denoising based on attractor dynamics in RNNs, but weak experimental validation.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgyAoRqFQ&amp;noteId=Bye5F_Hb6Q"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper857 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">08 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper857 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The authors propose to embed in a recurrent neural network (RNN) a multistage subnetwork that is trained to denoise its own state. This is done with an additional denoising cost term that essentially encourages the recurrent subnetwork to suppress noise during as the recurrence is unfolded in time.
The authors first demonstrate the denoising properties of this architecture, and then demonstrate its performance on a series of tasks combining it with regular tanh and GRU recurrent units.

The paper is clear and the main idea is rather interesting, but the presented experimental validations are arguably weak. The demonstration of the denoising properties of the network is rather superficial, in the sense that it does not give much insight into the functioning of the architecture, despite that presumably being the main goal of the section. In particular, it is not clear where the non-monotonic change in denoising as a function of network size comes from. Based on the attractor neural network literature that the authors cite at the beginning of the paper, it could be due to either the presence of spurious attractors, the absence of fixed-point attractors or the fact that the attractor network is trained above capacity. But the authors never go into a detailed analysis that could reveal the detailed functioning of their architecture and merely mention the hypothesis that for large networks denoising performance would decrease because of overfitting.
As for the experiments that are presented in the rest of the paper, while relevant, the types of tasks and datasets on which the proposed architecture is being tested are rather small.

Here are some more specific comments and questions:
- It would help to clarify the training procedure to explicitly mention in step 3 that training proceeds on sequences with added noise.
- It is not clear how many times in each experiments step 3 is being repeated for each mini-batch, i.e. what computational overhead is required for the training of the SDRNN compared to a regular RNN.  
- It is not clear whether the recurrent neural net called RNN with attractors (RNN+A) is indeed an attractor neural network. Does the state of the network indeed always converge to an attractor?

I think the work is quite novel, and it also connects to bodies of literature (hopfield networks -- attractors based and more mainstream GRU/LSTM nets). Here are some notes that I have: 

1) There is a citation to anonymous 1994 -- not sure if it helps with anything. Is this work published? Why not, 1994 is quite a bit ago! I can’t see any reason why from 1994 until now this should stay anonymous. 

2) Intuitively I like the idea of denoising. Though not sure exact what is denoised and towards what? In particular for hopfield networks (and I think most of the body of work that this paper points to), the idea is you have a set of sequences that you want to *memorize*. So you build a point attractor for each of this sequence, such that when starting the dynamical system in the vicinity of the point attractor (in its basin of attraction) then you converge to it (remembering the wanted sequence). Going back to this work, what is this sequence of patterns that we want to remember? More explicitly, for SDRNN you do backprop to get the h you would want and that make that a target (second loss) of the attractor net. But I'm confused about timescale. If h is not stable for a longer time, do you really converge on the attractor net ? Do we have evidence of that? Is this even meaningful early on in training, it feels like it should hurt.

3) Connecting to this, I would really love to see more analysis, going beyond measuring entropy. How do we now this is not just more capacity and the auxiliary loss just helps the optimization. Particularly since the problems are synthetic, not large scale more analysis should be possible.  How does this compare to training the simple RNN but with gaussian noise on h (to learn to be robust to it). Can we control for capacity between RNN and SDRNN? 

4) To that point there is this work (not citet as far as I can tell) : <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6026." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6026.</a> It does have a structure somewhat similar, though none of the denoising perspective or the auxiliary loss used in this work. However the work points out that if you make the network deep in a similar way to how it was done here even though technically it is a more powerful model, gradients do not propagate well. The solution was skip connection. In the baseline that was run you do not have skip connections, and the auxiliary loss might play the role of what skip connections or a more powerful optimizer would have played. </span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: Marginally below acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1gsJSsy2m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Review for State-Denoised Recurrent Neural Networks</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgyAoRqFQ&amp;noteId=S1gsJSsy2m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper857 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">26 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper857 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">In this paper the authors develop the clever idea to use attractor networks, inspired by Hopfield nets, to “denoise” a recurrent neural network.  The idea is that for every normal step of an RNN, one induces an additional "dimension" of recurrency in order to create attractor dynamics around that particular hidden state. The authors introduce their idea and run some basic experiments. This paper is well written and the idea is novel (to me) and worthy of exploration.  Unfortunately, the experiments are seriously lacking in my opinion, as I believe *the major focus* of those experiments should be comparisons to other denoising / regularization techniques.

MAJOR

The point is taken that RNNs are susceptible to noise due to iterated application of the function. In my experience, countering noise (in the sense of gaussian noise added) isn’t a huge problem in practice because there are many regularization methodologies to handle it. This leads me to the point that I think the experiments need to compare across a number of regularization techniques.  The paper is motivated by discussion of noise, “noise robustness is a highly desirable property in neural networks”, and the experiments show improved performance on smaller datasets, all of which speak to regularization. So I believe comparisons with regularization techniques are pretty important here. 

MODERATE

There is some motivation at the beginning of this piece, in particular about language, and does not contain citations, but should.

“Training is in complete batches to avoid the noise of mini-batch training.”  Please explain, I guess this is not a type of noise that the method handles? 

What about problems that require graded responses, which is likely anything requiring integration? For example,  what happens in the majority task if the inputs were switched to a non-discrete version, where one must hold analog numbers?


MINOR

Any discussion about the (presumably dramatic) increase in training time due to the attractor dynamics unrolling + additional batching due to noise vectors (if I understood correctly)?

What are your confidence intervals over?  Presumably, we’d like to get confidence over multiple network instantiations.

Pg 1. Articulated neural network? 


QUESTIONS

Does using a the ‘c’ variable as a bias instead of an initial condition really matter? 

How does supervised training via eqn (4) relate to the classic training of Hopfield nets? I assume not at all, but it would be useful to clarify?

What RNN architecture did you use in the Figure 5 simulations (tanh vanilla RNN or GRU?)
