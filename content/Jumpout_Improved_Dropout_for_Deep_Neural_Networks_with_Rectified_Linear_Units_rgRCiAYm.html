performance and prevent overfitting in deep neural networks (DNNs). In this
paper, we discuss three novel observations about dropout to better understand
the generalization of DNNs with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activations: 1)
dropout is a smoothing technique that encourages each local linear model of a
DNN to be trained on data points from nearby regions; 2) a constant dropout
rate can result in effective neural-deactivation rates that are significantly
different for layers with different fractions of activated neurons; and 3) the
rescaling factor of dropout causes an inconsistency to occur between the
normalization during training and testing conditions when batch normalization
is also used.  The above leads to three simple but nontrivial improvements to
dropout resulting in our proposed method "Jumpout." Jumpout samples the
dropout rate using a monotone decreasing distribution (such as the right part
of a truncated Gaussian), so the local linear model at each data point is
trained, with high probability, to work better for data points from nearby
than from more distant regions. Instead of tuning a dropout rate for each
layer and applying it to all samples, jumpout moreover adaptively normalizes
the dropout rate at each layer and every training sample/batch, so the
effective dropout rate applied to the activated neurons are kept the same.
Moreover, we rescale the outputs of jumpout for a better trade-off that keeps
both the variance and mean of neurons more consistent between training and
test phases, which mitigates the incompatibility between dropout and batch
normalization. Compared to the original dropout, jumpout shows significantly
improved performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Fashion- MNIST, STL10, SVHN,
ImageNet-1k, etc., while introducing negligible additional memory and
computation costs.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Dropout, deep neural networks with ReLU, local linear model</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Jumpout applies three simple yet effective modifications to dropout, based on novel understandings about the generalization performance of DNN with ReLU in local regions.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Skgo-Yg037" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>needs further empirical evidence</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1gRCiA5Ym&amp;noteId=Skgo-Yg037"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper943 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">06 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper943 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Authors propose three modifications to dropout, specifically in context of dropout applied to deep networks utilizing the ReLU non-linearity.  The three modifications seem independently motivated and aim to overcome separate potential shortcomings of the current dropout approach.  These three modifications are combined into a new approach termed Jumpout.

Overall I find this to be a weak paper requiring further work, for the following main reasons:

* The proposed modifications are intuitively motivated and then empirically supported.  However, I find the intuitive reasoning unclear and have to lean much more on empirical evidence.  For instance, the motivation for modification 2 “dropout rate adapted to number of active neurons”, is that in case ReLU causes a large number of neurons to ‘shut down’ then the dropout rate in that layer should be reduced (or increased, depending on how it is defined) causing fewer neurons to further dropout.  However, if preventing co-adaptation is a reason to dropout neurons then the issue of conditional correlation (or co-activation given related inputs) will remain regardless of number of active neurons in a layer, thus changing the dropout rate as a function of ReLU activation is not fully justified.  Similarly, modification 3 “rescale outputs to work with batch normalization” proposes exponentiation by -0.75 with weak justification as a compromise.

* I find the empirical evidence and support for the three modifications lacking in detail.  The authors provide results of the combined Jumpout technique on a number of tasks, but do not demonstrate effectiveness and contribution of individual modifications on error rates on the tasks they evaluated.

* I also find the baseline systems to be on the weaker side (e.g. on CIFAR100 many systems now have higher than 82% accuracy with best being over 84, on STL-10 many systems now are well above 85%).

that is designed to work better with batch normalization. Unfortunately, I did not understand the arguments on locally linear regions and ReLu and its relationship with the monotone dropout scheme,
or why the half Gaussian is chosen.

Still, jump out the procedure is fairly clear in Algorithm 1, and the results seems good.
However, I could not make out much of why each step is done, and could not find empirical tests of the value of each step.

I think the paper needs more work. All the proposals seem very heuristic, and it is important to test their separate effects. It should be easy to perform a ablation analysis since the 3 proposed steps are pretty independent and can be tested separately. Since two of these have to do with modifying the dropout rate, it would be important to compare with carefully cross-validated dropout rates, which I also do not see.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_B1eUKk9xi7" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Unconvincing experimental results and theoretical arguments </a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1gRCiA5Ym&amp;noteId=B1eUKk9xi7"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper943 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">14 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper943 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper proposes yet another variant of the celebrated Dropout algorithm. Specifically, the proposed method attempts to address the obvious drawbacks of Dropout: (i) the need to heuristically select the Dropout rate; and (ii) the universality of this selection across a layer. 

As the authors have admitted in the paper (Sec. 1.2), there is a variety of methods already addressing the same problem. They argue that contrary to some of these methods "jumpout does not rely on additional trained models: it adjusts the dropout rate solely based on the ReLU activation patterns. Moreover, jumpout introduces negligible computation and memory overhead relative to the original dropout methods, and can be easily incorporated into existing model architectures."

However, this is argument is certainly untrue and rather misleading. The works of Kingma et al. (2015) and Molchanov et al. (2017), that the authors cite, does not introduce additional trained models. In addition, there is additional related work that the authors do not cite, but ought to: 

[1] Yarin Gal, Jiri Hron, Alex Kendall, "Concrete Dropout," Proc. NIPS 2017.
[2] Yingzhen Li, Yarin Gal, "Dropout Inference in Bayesian Neural Networks with Alpha-divergences," Proc ICML 2017.
[3] Harris Partaourides, Sotirios Chatzis, “Deep Network Regularization via Bayesian Inference of Synaptic Connectivity,” J. Kim et al. (Eds.): PAKDD 2017, Part I, LNAI 10234, pp. 30–41, 2017. 

These methods also address a similar problem, without introducing extra networks or imposing extra costs art inference time. Thus, citing them, as well as COMPARING to them, is a necessity for this paper to be convincing.

These crucial shortcoming aside, there are various theoretical claims in this paper that are not sufficiently substantiated. To begin with, the arguments used in the last paragraph of page 4 seem at least speculative; then,  the authors proceed to propose a solution to the alleged problem in the beginning of page 5. They suggest sampling from a truncated Gaussian, but they do not elaborate on why this selection solves the problem; they limit themselves to noting that other selections, such as the Beta distribution, may also be considered in the future. We must also underline that [3] have suggested exactly that; sampling from a Beta. 

Finally, the last two modifications the authors propose seem reasonable, yet they are extremely heuristic. No one knows (which can be guaranteed through theoretical proofs or solid experimental evidence) that without these the method would not work. In addition, previous papers, e.g. [1-3] achieve similar goals in a principled fashion (ie by inferring proper posterior densities); without experimental comparisons, nobody knows which paradigm is best to adopt.
