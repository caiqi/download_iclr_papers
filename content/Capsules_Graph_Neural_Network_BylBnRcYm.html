However, when applying node embeddings learned from GNN to generate graph embeddings, the scalar node representation typically used in GNN may not suffice to preserve the node/graph relationships, resulting in sub-optimal graph embeddings.

Inspired by the Capsule Neural Network (CapsNet), we propose the Capsules Graph Neural Network (CapsGNN), which adopts the concept of capsules to address the weakness in existing GNN-based graph embeddings algorithms. By extracting node features in the form of capsules, routing mechanism can be utilized to capture important statistic information at the graph level. As a result, our model generates multiple embeddings for each graph to capture significant graph properties from different aspects. The attention module incorporated in CapsGNN is used to tackle graphs with various sizes which also enables the model to focus on critical parts of the graphs.

Our extensive evaluations with 9 graph-structured datasets demonstrate that CapsGNN has a high potential for large graph data analysis and powerful capability in capturing macroscopic properties of the whole graph. It outperforms other SOTA techniques on several graph classification tasks.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">CapsNet, Graph embedding, GNN</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Inspired by CapsNet, we propose a novel architecture for graph embeddings on the basis of node features extracted from GNN.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_rJlwCtK5nm" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>The proposed CapsGNN is original and achieves good results on some datasets; Some more discussions may further help.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byl8BnRcYm&amp;noteId=rJlwCtK5nm"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1544 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1544 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper was written with good quality and clarity. Their idea was original and experiment results show the proposed CapsGNN is effective in large graph data analysis, particularly on graphs with macroscopic properties.

Pros:

1) The paper makes a clear and detailed comparison between the proposed CapsGNN and the related models in section 3.2.

2) Use of capsules nets and routing in CapsGNN are close to that in the original CapsNet, with the core characteristics (and potential advantages) of capsules and dynamic routing being perserved in the proposed CapsGNN to handle the targeted problem. 

3) The comparison and model analysis are thorough and comprehensive.

Cons or unclear points:

1) Why the paper does not include all biological datasets (6 datasets in total, only 4 used in this papaer) presented in (Verma &amp; Zhang, 2018) in the experiment section. The experiments in Verma &amp; Zhang, (2018) show that the GCAPS-CNN achieved SOTA results on nearly all biological datasets. Does GCAPS-CNN outperformed CapsGNN on biological datasets? It will be nice if there is comparison on more datasets and more analysis is provided between CapsGNN and GCAPS-CNN.

2) Why CapsGNN is not suitable for preserving information of fine structures? Can the authors give more explanation and discussions?

First, hierarchical node level capsules are extracted using GCN layers. Second, after weighting each capsule by the output of a proposed attention module, graph level capsules are computed by performing a global dynamic routing. These graph level capsules are used for training a capsule classifier using a margin loss and a reconstruction loss.

The general architecture seems to be a reasonable application of the capsule principle in the graph domain, following the proof of concept MNIST architecture proposed by Sabour et al.

My main concern is that I have problems grasping the motivation behind using capsules in the given scenario. Besides an unprecise motivation in the introduction, there is no clear reason why the routing mechanism helps with solving the given tasks. Capsule networks capture pose covariances by applying a linear, trainable transformation to pose vectors and computing the agreement of the resulting votes. It is not clear to me how discrete information like graph connectivity can be encoded in a pose vector so that linear transformations are able to match different "connectivity poses".

Is there a more formal argument that explains why capsules should be able to capture more information about the input graph than other GCNNs?

Also, some design choices seem to be quite arbitrary. One example is using the last feature maps of the GCN as positions for coordinate addition. Is there a theoretical/intuitive motivation for this?

Results for the given experiments show improvement on some graphs. However, the authors proposed several concepts: a global pooling method using dynamic routing, an attention mechanism, a novel reconstruction loss, interpreting deep node embeddings as spatial positions. It is not clear to what extent the individual aspects of the method contribute to the gains. The qualitative capsule embedding analysis is interesting. However, this part needs a comparison to standard global graph embeddings to see if there is a significant difference.

In my opinion, the paper needs:
1) a clear experimental evaluation showing that capsules and the dynamic routing lead to improved results (i.e. by providing an ablation study to show which gains result from the attention-based global pooling mechanism, the reconstruction loss, the dynamic routing and from the coordinate addition), or
2) a more precise motivation for the use of dynamic routing to capture correlation between pose vectors in graphs in general (i.e. formal arguments why the method is stronger in capturing statistics or for what types of graphs it provides more discriminative power).

Overall, the paper does not convince me that capsules and dynamic routing provide advantages if used like the authors propose. Therefore, I tend to voting for rejecting the paper as long as points 1) and 2) are not addressed properly.


Minor remarks:

- There are quite a lot of grammatical errors (especially missing articles).</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_ByxrZRED3m" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>A long paper with incomplete experiments</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byl8BnRcYm&amp;noteId=ByxrZRED3m"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1544 AnonReviewer2</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">31 Oct 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper1544 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper fuses Capsule Networks with Graph Neural Networks. The idea seems technically correct and is well-written. With 13 pages the paper seems really long. Moreover, the experimental part seems to be too short. So, the theoretical and experimental part is not well-balanced.

Minor concerns/ notes to the authors:
1.	Page 1: The abbreviation GNN is used before it is defined.
2.	Page 2: I guess there is a mistake in your indices. Capital N == n or?
3.	Page 4: What is \mathbf{I}? I guess you mean the identity matrix.
4.	Page 4: Could you define/describe C_all?
5.	Page 5: Can you describe how you perform the coordinate addition or add a reference?
6.	Page 6: The idea to use reconstruction as regularization method is not new. May you can add a respective reference?
7.	Page 8: The abbreviations in your result tables are confusing. They are not aligned with the text. For example, what is Caps-CNN for a model?

My major concern is about your experimental evaluation. Under a first look the result tables looking great. But thatâ€™s due to fact, that you marked the two best values in bold type. To be more precise, the method WL is in the most cases better than your proposed method. This makes me wondering if there is a real improvement by your method. It would be easier to decide if you would present the training/inference times and the number of parameters. By having that, I could relate your results regarding an accuracy-complexity tradeoff.  Moreover, your t-SNE and attention visualizations are not convincing. As you may know, the output of a t-SNE strongly dependents on the chosen hyper-parameters like the perplexity, etc. You not mentioned the setting of these values. Additionally, it is hard to decide if your embeddings are good or not because you are not presenting a baseline or referencing a respective work. You are complaining that this is due to the space restrictions. But you have unlimited capacity in the appendix. So please provide some clarifying plots. Finally, Iâ€™m also not convinced that your attention mechanism works as expected. Itâ€™s again due to missing baseline results and/or a reference. If itâ€™s not possible to add one of them, you could perform an easy experiment where you freeze your fully-connected layers of the attention module to fixed values (maybe such that it performs just an averaging) and repeat your experiments. In case your attention module works as expected you should observe a real change in terms of accuracy and in your visualizations too.
You could also think about to publish your code or present further results/plots in a separate blog.
