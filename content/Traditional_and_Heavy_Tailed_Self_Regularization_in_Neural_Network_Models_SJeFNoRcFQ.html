Empirical and theoretical results clearly indicate that the empirical spectral density (ESD) of DNN layer matrices displays signatures of traditionally-regularized statistical models, even in the absence of exogenously specifying traditional forms of regularization, such as Dropout or Weight Norm constraints.  Building on recent results in RMT, most notably its extension to Universality classes of Heavy-Tailed matrices, we develop a theory to identify 5+1 Phases of Training, corresponding to increasing amounts of Implicit Self-Regularization.  For smaller and/or older DNNs, this Implicit Self-Regularization is like traditional Tikhonov regularization, in that there is a "size scale" separating signal from noise.  For state-of-the-art DNNs, however, we identify a novel form of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, similar to the self-organization seen in the statistical physics of disordered systems.  This implicit Self-Regularization can depend strongly on the many knobs of the training process.  By exploiting the generalization gap phenomena, we demonstrate that we can cause a small model to exhibit all 5+1 phases of training simply by changing the batch size.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">statistical mechanics, self-regularization, random matrix, glassy behavior, heavy-tailed</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">See the abstract.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">6 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_H1gn4x1MaX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Although the experiments seem interesting,  theoretical results are not clearly presented.</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJeFNoRcFQ&amp;noteId=H1gn4x1MaX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper22 AnonReviewer4</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">09 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper22 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This manuscript studies the implicit regularization of neural networks from the perspective of random matrix theory. The authors provide both empirical and theoretical results that aim to show that the empirical spectral density of weights of DNN captures the implicit regularization phenomenon. However, the results are far from rigorous theory and it is not clear how recent results in MP theory yields the statements made in the paper. 


Detailed comments:

1. The empirical studies seem interesting. It seems that two kinds of results are shown. The first one is that ESD fits perfectly for small models, and the second one is that deep models fit heavy-tailed random matrices class. It would be interesting to see more details about how these models are trained, as training greatly affects the value of the weights.

2. Theoretical results are not clearly stated. In section 2, the authors introduce the basics of MP theory. However, it is not clear how to derive the theory in this paper based on the MP theory. It seems that the main theory is the "5+1 phases of training". The definition of these 6 phases is not even explicitly given in this paper. Moreover, the theory of all these phases seems to depend on equation (3) , but there are no lemmas or propositions that gives a rigourious theoretical guarantee.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1lZZNN5nQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting idea but not made rigorous/precise</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJeFNoRcFQ&amp;noteId=r1lZZNN5nQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper22 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper22 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper analyzes the empirical spectral density of DNN layher matrices and compares them with the traditionally-regularized statistical models, and develop a theory to identify 5+1 phases of training based on it. The results with different batch sizes illustrate the Generalization Gap pheneomena, and explains it as being causes by implicit self-regularization.

However, the paper seems a little bit handwavy to me, without any serious theoretical justification. For example, why are \mu=2 and 4 chosen as the threshold between weakly/moderately/very heavy-tailed? In addition, the paper is build upon o the 5+1 model as in Figure 2 and the graphical comparison between the empirical ESD and the expected ESD of the five models in Table 1, and they lack any mathematical/rigorous definition---see table 2. The simulations are performs over a particular data set and a particular setting, and I wonder if the observations would be different for a different data set and a different setting. 

As a result, it may give some important intuition, but the content is not sufficiently rigorous to my knowledge.

AnonReviewer3 is declining to accept empirical evidence. If you are going to make an "educated guess" without basic understanding, don't review highly technical papers.   

1.   \mu ranges are basically lack of reviewers RMT knowledge. Paper rigorously cites the findings where how this range is applied. These are established solidly in RMT.
2.  Reviewer complaint on Figure 2 and Table 1 saying "they lack any mathematical/rigorous definition". This is absolutely not true. Spectral theory is very well established in mathematical theory along with RMT this paper uses.
3. "if the observations would be different for a different data set and a different setting. " This is totally absurd. There is no way that any single machine learning paper can test all datasets and different settings. Paper used large range of different architectures and presented the empirical evidence as any published machine learning paper.

I strongly recommend Chairs to not give any further reviews to this reviewer.  Reviewing without good-faith is a disservice to the community.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_S1gvacTwiX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Spectral properties of deep learning architectures are key to understand generalisation problems</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJeFNoRcFQ&amp;noteId=S1gvacTwiX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures"><a href="/profile?id=~Mehmet_Suezen1" class="profile-link">Mehmet Suezen</a></span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">20 Oct 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper22 Public Comment</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Comment: </span><span class="note_content_value">Authors have shown a clearly original contribution by directly mapping a classification of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to resulting weight matrices of deep architectures empirically. The resulting taxonomy would help in understanding under what circumstances trained networks generalised better. This approach is novel because it avoids causality objections while it classify networks without any response metric.  Moreover, the intimate connection between statistical mechanics and deep learning architectures are often omitted by practitioners up to now, but it may be a mainstream approach in the near future.

The authors propose an analysis which offers a fresh view to this problem. This view has been articulated very well, and is based on sound mathematical arguments. 

On the other hand, since there is no formal theorem to support the introduced assumptions, the authors have attempted to provide empirical evidence through experiments with standard DNN architectures and benchmark datasets. However, this is where the weakness of this paper lies: The provided empirical evidence, while nicely executed, is not enough to convince the critical reader. We need experiments with more diverse datasets and experimental setups. 

Although I accept the claim of the authors concerning the lack of space, they could also trim the Introduction so as to free up some space, as well as provide an indefinite number of extra supporting evidence in the form of Supplementary Material/Appendices.
