In practice, the momentum parameter is often chosen in a heuristic fashion with little theoretical guidance. In this work, we use the framework of algorithmic stability to provide an upper-bound on the generalization error for the class of strongly convex loss functions, under mild technical assumptions. Our bound decays to zero inversely with the size of the training set, and increases as the momentum parameter is increased. We also develop an upper-bound on the expected true risk,  in terms of the number of training steps, the size of the training set, and the momentum parameter.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">Generalization Error, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Uniform Stability</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">TL;DR: </span><span class="note_content_value">Stochastic gradient method with momentum generalizes.</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_r1lvWTHc2X" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting question and direction</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1lwRjR9YX&amp;noteId=r1lvWTHc2X"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper901 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">03 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper901 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper presents an analysis of generalization error of SGD with multiple passes for strongly convex objectives using the framework of algorithmic stability [Bousquet and Elisseef, 2002] and its recent use to analyze generalization error of SGD based methods [Hardt, Recht and Singer 2016].

The problem considered by this work is interesting and raises the possibility of understanding generalization related questions of SGD style methods when augmented with momentum, which is common practice in Deep Learning [Sutskever et al. 2013]. That said, there are some concerns about the results as presented in this paper, which I will elaborate below:

- Consider the stability bound admitted by theorem 2: The special case (similar to theorem 3.9 of Hardt et al 2016) when the learning rate alpha = 1/beta (which is the typical learning rate that theory advocates), and setting kappa = beta/gamma where kappa is the condition number of the problem, leads to the following bound on momentum allowed by theorem 2, which is:

(something non-positive) &lt;= mu &lt; 1/(3*kappa). 

This is basically the regime where momentum does not make any difference towards accelerating optimization. Referring to the standard value of momentum for strongly convex functions, we see that the momentum is set as mu = (sqrt(kappa)-1)/(sqrt(kappa)+1) [Nesterov, 1983], or, mu = ( (sqrt(kappa)-1)/(sqrt(kappa)+1) )^2  [Polyak,1964]. Upon simplification of this standard momentum values, we see that mu \approx 1 - 1/sqrt(kappa) which grows close to one as kappa grows large. On the other hand, the momentum values admitted by the paper for their bound is super tiny (which gets to zero as the condition number kappa grows large). This essentially implies there is not much about momentum that is captured by the bound of theorem 2 since there is no characterization of the provided bound for theoretically advocated and practically used parameters for momentum.

- In proposition 1, there is no quantitative description of what "sufficiently small" mu (momentum parameter) is - this statement is imprecise. As mentioned in the previous point, sufficiently small mu really is not descriptive of momentum parameters employed in practice (mu in practice typically is &gt;= 0.9). For strongly convex objectives, this should be closer to 1- (1/sqrt(kappa)). Sufficiently small mu parameter essentially does not yield quantitatively different behaviors compared to standard SGD. 


In summary, while this paper attempts to make progress on an interesting question, but falls short and doesn't really capture the behavior of these methods that is even mildly reflective of practice (even in terms of the parameter regimes admitted by the bounds proven in the theorems).

- This paper does not perform a thorough literature survey of published results. Furthermore, this paper does not present a precise treatment of assumptions (and implications) amongst other works cited in the paper (see for e.g. [4] below). 

[1] Polyak (1987) presents (generalization) behavior of Heavy Ball momentum with noisy (inexact) gradients.
[2] Several efforts in Signal Processing literature do consider the similar setting as one considered by this paper, which is that of Heavy Ball (called accelerated LMS) method with noisy gradients: refer to Proakis (1974), Roy and Shynk (1990), Sharma et al. (1998). 
[3] Kidambi et al (2018) estimate the "optimization" power (which is a part of characterization of generalization error [Bach and Moulines 2011], since this dominates at the start of optimization) of HB method with Stochastic Gradients and prove that HB+stochastic gradients does not offer any speedup over vanilla SGD.
[4] Loizou and Richtarik provide an analysis of stochastic heavy ball with super large batch sizes (so they end up showing accelerated rates) under similar assumptions as considered by this paper, such as assuming the function is smooth and strongly convex. However, the paper dismisses the work of Loizou and Richtarik to be working with a different set of assumptions - this is not really true.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: Ok but not good enough - rejection</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Skl1MikYnX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Review</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1lwRjR9YX&amp;noteId=Skl1MikYnX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper901 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper901 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">This paper studies the algorithmic stability of SGD with momentum and provides an upper-bound on true risk through convergence analysis.
This bound clarifies dependencies of convergence speed on the size of dataset and the momentum parameter.

The presentation is easy to follow and technically sounds good.
SGD with momentum is heavily used for learning linear models and deep neural networks, hence to analyze its convergence behavior is quite important.
This paper achieves this goal well by extending a previous result on vanilla SGD in a straightforward manner, although it is not technically difficult.

The author(s) provide stability and generalization bounds for SGD with momentum for strongly convex, smooth, and Lipschitz losses. 

This paper basically follows and extends the results from (Hardt, Recht, and Singer, 2016). Section 2 is quite identical but without mentioning the overlap from Section 2 in (Hardt et al, 2016). The analysis closely follows the approach from there. 

The proof of Theorem 2 has some issues. The set of assumptions (smooth, Lipschitz and strongly convex) is not valid on the whole set R^d, for example quadratic function. In this case, your Lipschitz constant L would be arbitrarily large and could be damaged your theoretical result. To consider projected step is true, but the proof without projection (and then explaining in the end) should have troubles. 

From the theoretical results, it is not clear that momentum parameter affects positively or negatively. In Theorem 3, what is the advantage of this convergence compared to SGD? It seems that it is not better than SGD. Moreover, if \mu = 0 and \gamma &gt; 0, it seems not able to recover the linear convergence to neighborhood of SGD. Please also notice that, in this situation, L also could be large. 

The topic could be interesting but the contributions are very incremental. At the current state, I do not support the publications of this paper.
