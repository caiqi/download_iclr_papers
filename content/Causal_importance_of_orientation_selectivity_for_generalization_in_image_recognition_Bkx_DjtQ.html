Recently, Morcos et al. (2018) examined the effect of class-selective units in DNNs, i.e., units with high-level selectivity, on network generalization, concluding that hidden units that are selectively activated by specific input patterns may harm the network's performance. In this study, we revisit their hypothesis, considering units with selectivity for lower-level features, and argue that selective units are not always harmful to the network performance. Specifically, by using DNNs trained for image classification, we analyzed the orientation selectivity of individual units. Orientation selectivity is a low-level selectivity widely studied in visual neuroscience, in which, when images of bars with several orientations are presented to the eye, many neurons in the visual cortex respond selectively to a specific orientation. We found that orientation-selective units exist in both lower and higher layers of DNNs, as in our brain. In particular, units in the lower layers become more orientation-selective as the generalization performance improves during the course of training of the DNNs. Consistently, networks that generalize better are more orientation-selective in the lower layers. We finally reveal that ablating these selective units in the lower layers substantially degrades the generalization performance. These results suggest to the machine-learning community that, contrary to the triviality of units with high-level selectivity, lower-layer units with selectivity for low-level features are indispensable for generalization, and for neuroscientists, orientation selectivity does play a causally important role in object recognition.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Keywords: </span><span class="note_content_value">deep learning, neuroscience</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"><div class="item" id="reply_count">3 Replies</div></div></div><hr class="small" /><div id="note_children"><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_Bkec4IPNTX" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Interesting and well-written paper</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkx_Dj09tQ&amp;noteId=Bkec4IPNTX"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper276 AnonReviewer3</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">10 Nov 2018</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper276 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">The paper presents a study on orientation selectivity in DNNs for image classification, arguing that this type of selectivity in the lower layers is crucial for generalization. This hypothesis is tested through an ablation study, which the authors interpret as a suggestion of the existence of a causal relation.

The authors tackle a very interesting problem that seems to have not received yet enough attention. The paper is quite well-written and clear, making it understandable also to non-experts. The only concern I would have is about the causal claims in Section 3.4. I’m not completely sure the ablation experiments are the correct way to “prove” causality, as opposed to somehow trying to intervene on the orientation selectivity directly. On the other hand, this seems complicated to prove and the approach proposed in the paper seems a pragmatic solution. I would possibly hedge slightly the causal claims.

From an outsider point of view, I think the paper provides an interesting contribution to the discussion on orientation selectivity. I particularly appreciated its clarity and reproducibility.

This is analyzed with respect to generalization performance in decisions made. Overall, the paper is well written and interesting. However, I have a number of comments / concerns as described below:

Positives:
- The paper presents an in depth analysis of the role of orientation selectivity in neural hierarchies. This style of analysis is sorely lacking and fits the theme of learning representations
- The paper itself is well written and quite polished
- The authors have taken great care to rule out any possible confounds through experiments that are not identical to the main claims or objective (specifically the study of section 3.3)

To address:
- The only concern I have (and it is somewhat significant), is the notion of "generalization". This is a rather loaded term, and it is not clear on cursory inspection where this generalization comes from. Is it a function of invariance among higher layers to scene geometry? What are the fundamental underpinnings of these observations outside of correlation to orientation selectivity.
- It seems almost a tautology that removing orientation selectivity would impair performance. I would be more satisfied, and render a higher rating if I felt there was a "smoking gun" with respect to evidence. The conclusion is convincing, but the reasoning comes across as somewhat vague. With that said, it is also understood that this is a non-trivial matter to address and perhaps this paper is an important first step.</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Rating: </span><span class="note_content_value">6: Marginally above acceptance threshold</span></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Confidence: </span><span class="note_content_value">4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct</span></div><div class="reply_row clearfix"></div></div><div class="children"></div></div><div class="note_with_children"><div id="note_SkggGK2KhQ" class="note panel"><div class="title_pdf_row clearfix"><h2 class="note_content_title"><a>Straightforward paper, but unclear what we learn from it</a>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-default permalink-button" title="Link to this comment" data-permalink-url="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkx_Dj09tQ&amp;noteId=SkggGK2KhQ"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></button></h2></div><div class="meta_row"><span class="signatures">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper276 AnonReviewer1</span></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="meta_row pull-left"><span class="date item">02 Nov 2018 (modified: 07 Nov 2018)</span><span class="item">ICLR 2019 Conference Paper276 Official Review</span><span class="item">Readers: <span class="readers-icon glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span> Everyone</span></div><div class="meta_row meta_actions"></div></div><div class="note_contents"><span class="note_content_field">Review: </span><span class="note_content_value">Summary:
The authors find that (1) DNNs exhibit orientation selectivity in many of their hidden layers' units, (2) in the intermediate layers this selectivity emerges during training, concurrently with the network's ability to generalize, and (3) ablating orientation-selective units in the early layers impairs a network's generalization performance. 

Strengths:
+ Very straightforward and easy to follow 
+ Technically sound

Weaknesses:
- Feels trivial
- The claims seem to be too general

Conclusion:
I'm torn on the paper. On the one hand, it reports some potentially interesting observations (e.g. trajectory of emergence of orientation selectivity over training). On the other hand, I'm not really sure what we learn from the paper.


Specific comments:

- The result seems trivial. How should a network be able to recognize objects without detecting edges of certain orientation (which implies orientation selectivity)?

- Related to the previous point, pretty much every single (supervised or unsupervised) learning objective investigated so far has produced orientation selectivity, so it seems pretty well established that orientation selectivity is somehow useful. The interesting question is what needs to be done on top of it in order to get a representation useful for object recognition, but in this respect the paper does not contribute anything.

- The results are mostly on CIFAR-10 and only one network (VGG-16) trained on ImageNet is considered. Given the generality of the claims ("orientation selectivity [plays] a causally important role in object recognition" – abstract), the authors would have to show that their results also hold for other high-performing networks on ImageNet, and not just VGG-16 (sort of, see next point). Otherwise, an appropriate conclusion would be that orientation selectivity plays a causal role in the functioning of VGG-16 and some networks trained on CIFAR-10.

- The analysis meant to establish causality (section 3.4) produces pretty mixed results on VGG-16 (Fig. A6b), where ablating the top 50% orientation-selective units in some layers has a *smaller* effect than ablating the rest. How do the authors explain this result?
